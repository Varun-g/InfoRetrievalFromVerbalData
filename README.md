# InfoRetrievalFromVerbalData - AMAL

Hereafter everything will be referred to with above folder as base

```
1)The Base folder / absolute path root =    diarize-jruby
2)User media files folder - UserFiles
3)If you want to create a new user for now , manually create a directory within UserFiles with the username(eg:- like ive done with the folder 'amal')
4)Put the audio file you want to diarize within this newly created user folder within UserFiles (eg:-Userfiles/amal/d.wav)
5)The rest of the folder structure is created by the split.py script i wrote  , automatically, and is self explanatory.
```

## split.py inputs 

```
*user name - same as the folder you created within UserFiles for your user
*audio file name - the name of the file you placed in this user folder to be diarized.
```
```
Then sit back , grab some pop corn and enjoy the Magic ;)
