Got my mojo back after having a few of their appetite teasers&&&&food
Love LPW for a no-frills bite to eat&&&&food
Don't go here for the decor,&&&&ambience
the staff is friendly and the fried pickles are very tasty&&&&food+service
for a sports-bar type venue, these folks do it all right, and do so at the right price&&&&ambience+cost+food
The lady got a cheeseburger and fries, I got scrod and broccoli, we split an order of their fried pickles as an app&&&&food+service
The pickles were dill spears coated with just the right amount of what was likely a beer batter and deep fried to tangy perfection&&&&cost+food
They got the spears vs&&&&food
The lady usually looks askew at this type of fare,&&&&cost
happily camped out over the plate and ate her fair share&&&&ambience
The fries were very lightly battered and done perfectly, with just the right amount of crispness outside followed by a creamy interior,&&&&ambience+cost+food
the fry guy here knows his craft&&&&food
And the burger was good as well&&&&food
I find it difficult to fawn excessively over  a burger&&&&food
The scrod was a very generous sized portion, nicely caramelized and served with lemon and&&&&food+service
When I was given the option of fries or baked potato or rice I asked if there were a green option and broccoli was offered, it was done perfectly as well and the amount was easily enough for two to share&&&&ambience+cost+food
My dinner came with a salad, which happily WAS NOT from a bag-o-lettuce,&&&&food
rather freshly cut romaine, a cuke slice or two, carrot shreds and tomato, and it was accompanied by a store bought dinner roll and&&&&ambience+food
The service was quite good, although the waitress appeared to be a bit over-extended,&&&&food+service
Happily they are in the Cleveland Entertainment book, and as I had the coupon sitting on the table during the meal, the waitress took the value off of the ticket before it was even presented&&&&ambience
We both stated that we will go back in a heartbeat&&&&food
If you like fried food and laid back,&&&&food
the people are great, the restaurant is laid back and casual and the food, while not very creative, is cooked well, presented well and the prices are not ridiculous&&&&cost+food
THE CLASSIC BURGER IS AMAZING&&&&food
It's definitely a top ten burger&&&&food
The fries are good too&&&&food
I was not impressed with how gross this place is - I wasn't sure I wanted to order anything&&&&service
The food was not outstanding&&&&food
Okay bar food&&&&ambience+food
Nice bar setting&&&&ambience+food
food is average, service is average and in general doesn't really art itself apart in anything&&&&food+service
Would I go out of my way to go there or make note of it to others? Probably not vegetable soup was good though and wings were fairly priced&&&&ambience+cost+food
Not even in the strip mall I used to hit in Hudson on my dry cleaning route back in the day&&&&ambience+food
it opened at fucking 11&&&&service
Breezed through Peninsula&&&&ambience
Ended up backtracking through Brecksville and I remembered an old friend&&&&ambience
Cozied up to the bar and ordered a Killians, plus cheesesteak to go(for pooch)&&&&ambience+food+service

The bar was all old men&&&&ambience
Matt, I don't know how you do it&&&&ambience
I dropped a three dollar tip on that barmaid's ass&&&&ambience

Cheap brews, cheaper food&&&&cost+food
Okay, so it is a bar with an old fashioned family restaurant attached&&&&ambience
We were there almost 2 hours for the Tuesday night burger special&&&&food
They need more staff&&&&service
The table was a little sticky&&&&ambience
However, the food was delicious&&&&food
The French fries were nice and crispy, and the Half pound burger didn't taste like a pre-made frozen patty&&&&food
Our total bill was $15&&&&cost
3 stars is fair for this pub&&&&ambience
The food is good and well priced for a bar&&&&ambience+cost+food
Tuesday has $5 burgers and chicken sandwiches&&&&food
I got the chicken dinner, it came with a 6 oz chicken, broccoli, steamed potatoes, salad, and roll&&&&ambience+food
I'd stick with the burgers though&&&&food
The salad was fresh&&&&ambience+food
Their fries are really good&&&&food
It's a bar with tables in the next room&&&&ambience
Service was good, food, not so much&&&&food+service
Everything tasted like it came from a can&&&&food
Nothing fresh or tasty about it&&&&ambience+food
Have dined in twice now and today was take out for corned beef sandwich&&&&food
Food is at best "ok"&&&&food
This would be ok if this place was a hidden dive bar with amazing food- not the case&&&&ambience+food
Dry corned beef, probably the worst I ever have had&&&&food
This place is very dark and dingy on the inside&&&&ambience
It is the cliche of townie bar&&&&ambience
The food was just okay&&&&food
the drinks were super cheap and the service was good&&&&cost+food+service
This small tavern, has great burgers and the best fries within 100 miles&&&&food
I understand they added music on the weekend and will surely check it out on the weekend&&&&ambience

Then that food is awesome&&&&ambience+food
Very friendly atmosphere&&&&service
Prompt service&&&&food+service
Diner/Bar type place with no particular theme&&&&ambience
)  Not a foodie spot or hidden gem,&&&&ambience+food
Also sorry to the other guest whose bill I signed for them&&&&cost
it's your typical neighborhood bar in the evening (it's typically middle-aged locals, not a rowdy crowd)&&&&ambience
it's also a great place to grab a nice meal with your family during the day&&&&food
They also have a fish fry every Friday during Lent&&&&food
The food is really good for bar food, and it's very reasonably priced&&&&ambience+cost+food
if you're looking for a cheap and inviting place to hang out with friends and family, this is a great place, and the food is great for what it is&&&&cost+food
Food decent&&&&food
Terrible cell phone signal and no WiFi&&&&ambience
Waited for ever for someone to tell us to seat ourselves and&&&&food
waited forever for the waitress to come over it seemed they were very busy gossiping at the counter&&&&ambience
Food was so-so nothing special the salads good use cheese served very plain&&&&food
If ever in Brecksville stop over at the neighborhood bar for cheap, quality food (you get what you pay for though), a typical old bar atmosphere, free popcorn, and sit in chairs that I swear haven't changed since I was 5&&&&ambience+cost+food
The place is awesome, I'm there every weekend&&&&ambience

Ah, Khotan&&&&ambience+food
a perfect blend of Asia's decor and food&&&&ambience+food
While I still appreciate your service and your stunning looks, I am surprised by what has happened to your menu&&&&food+service
shouts out to Santa Barbara&&&&ambience
), uninspired hot foods (kung pao shrimp at $21? For real?? )&&&&ambience+food
even the drinks are sorry in comparison to what once was&&&&food
Perhaps this is why you are closing your doors from November 30th through January 3rd (Seriously? During one of the busiest times of the year in Vegas&&&&ambience
?) At least you still have your Treasure Island pirate show, which will always be a sight to behold&&&&cost
, I will continue to hold onto hope that you will find your spotlight (or at least a better menu) once again&&&&ambience
Khotan sucks as a place to eat&&&&ambience+food
We went during happy hour so it was suppose to be cheaper,&&&&cost
it don't mean the size is bigger&&&&service
I ordered some spicy tuna and it was $7 for like a tiny portion that didn't do anything for me at all&&&&food+service
The only reason this place got two stars out of me was the bartender&&&&ambience+food
They both were entertaining and he gave us some drinks for free&&&&food
we didnt have a spot in mind&&&&ambience
on our many, many, many walks on the strip we found Khotan&&&&ambience+food
So I decided to call and make a reservation since I didnt know whether it was a forsure spot we would get in for dinner&&&&ambience
* We got there and were greeted and waited in the longue/bar area&&&&ambience
it was def cute, we were soon taken to our seats in the patio area (which i also do recommend esp if you come around the 9 o' clock time frame for the pirates show&&&&cost+food
you hit the patio/seating area and you get a great view of the strip AND the pirate show&&&&cost+food
The food was great, me and my bf def recommend the chicken lollipops for a appetizer (get two bc i could finish that whole plate if i didnt have to share with my bf HAHAHA)&&&&ambience+food
You def wont regret it, I ordered the Khotan Beef plate and it was actually good&&&&ambience+food+service
My boyfriend had the Orange chicken plate I believe and he enjoyed that plate as well although he did wish he had more food on there&&&&ambience+food
hahaOverall, great place for some pan Asian food, GREAT SERVICE btw&&&&food+service
, great views, free show of the pirate show w/o the bussling of the crowds, patio seating is great and def a great overall resturant in vegas&&&&cost+food
We ordered from the cocktail happy hour and I got some cranberry concoction (don't remember the name) and my friend had the asian pear&&&&food+service
She did love her asian pear though since it was pretty sweet&&&&food
the couple next to us took advantage of the happy hour prices&&&&cost+food
Bartender was really nice as well&&&&ambience+food
I enjoyed the quietness in the busy Vegas atmosphere on a Thursday night&&&&ambience
I love the decor and vibe of Khotan&&&&ambience+food
once you enter, it's worth the search&&&&cost
Spicy tuna roll - just enough spice, quality fishCurry noodles - love the curry they used, definitely singaporean&&&&food
big shrimps&&&&food
Ginger chicken with broccoli - a lighter option with clean flavors&&&&ambience+food
Our sever recommended his favorite drinks and was helpful answering questions about the food&&&&food+service
This would be a great date spot&&&&ambience+food
Worst sushi rolls ever -- the shape and size of a box of Tic Tacs with chewy rice and a rectangular layer of raw fish on the top&&&&food
Bland, difficult to eat&&&&food
We were hoping it was the same chef as Social House (restaurant at what is now Khotan's spot) because there was a jalapeno yellowtail sashimi on the menu (like the amazing one we'd had at Social House two years ago)&&&&ambience+food
When we started walking upstairs to get our table, the maitre 'd called out, "Watch your step because if you fall, I'd have to laugh at you&&&&ambience
"So, they can't make sushi and they have some clueless staffers too&&&&service
Don't waste your time or if you insist on going, try the hot foods versus the sushi rolls&&&&ambience+food
My girlfriend and I stayed at TI and we were looking for an easy dinner one night, so we decided to stroll into Khotan&&&&ambience+food
I wouldn't say the food was bad,&&&&food
amateurish&&&&ambience
It would be hard to believe that they had real sushi chefs in the kitchen, or that they used high quality fish&&&&food
Some of the fish didn't taste like anything&&&&food
The service was pretty good,&&&&food+service
our waiter didn't seem to know much about fish&&&&food+service
Don't waste your money on the Jalepeno Hamachi appetizer&&&&food
I don't know how anyone could have the nerve to charge $22 for 5 tiny pieces low grade Hamachi (if it even was Hamachi) on a chip&&&&cost+food
The Tuna Tartare wasn't that great either&&&&food
The concept of the Salmon Parmesan roll sounded good,&&&&ambience
when eating it, the Parmesan didn't make sense&&&&food
I was in the mood for noodles, so we also ordered the Crab Lo Mein&&&&food+service
It was basically ramen noodles with a few pieces of tasteless crab on top&&&&food
I could've made ramen noodles and topped it with imitation crab for about $2 and it would have been just as good, or better, than their $14 dish&&&&food
I have to say our seating was amazing out on the scenic deck&&&&food
However, I do have to say, that the food was blah&&&&food
I ordered the Salt and Pepper Prawns and the waiter expressed to me that they had a few shells underneath HOWEVER the Prawns came whole, fried with shells and eyes&&&&ambience+food+service
couldn't eat through these,,,he said well, I told you that it came with shells and half-heartely offered to recook them&&&&ambience+food
This only after the plate had been sitting for twenty minutes&&&&ambience+food
He avoided our table like the plague as I could tell he could clearly see I was NOT eating&&&&ambience+food
Only 4 stars because of the expense--without our $55 Groupon, our meal for two, including one large house sake, would have been over $100&&&&cost
However, even if we hadn't had the Groupon, it would have been WELL worth the money&&&&cost
The decor is gorgeous, we were waited on by two attentive garcons (sat at the sushi bar so chatted with the sushi chefs as well), and the menu is extremely creative and--most importantly--DELICIOUS&&&&ambience+food
Our waiter recommended the yellowtail appetizer with tempura jalepenos in a light, yummy sauce and WOW was he right&&&&ambience+food+service
We both "mm'd" through our whole meal, starting right from the tasty beginning&&&&ambience+food
Every piece of sushi (we got the large maki for dinner so we received about 20 pieces of sushi) was fresh, generous and absolutely fantastic&&&&ambience+food+service
By the time we finished our large dinner order we were almost full,&&&&service
definitely not ready to stop eating&&&&food
We each ordered another round of nigiri--my boyfriend got tuna and I got salmon, YUM&&&&service
Tasted just "bleh"&&&&food
Miso soup was very salty and ginger salad was made from a lot of weird lettuce that was not cut small and difficult to eat&&&&food
Took a long time to get the salad&&&&food
We asked to sit on the balcony to watch the show and they gave us a table at the backside so we couldn't see&&&&ambience
Service was barely ok and kept making excuses why it was taking so long&&&&ambience+food+service
A Superficial place in Treasure Island, trying too hard to be upscale, however, the food quality does not meet its price tag, which is way overly priced&&&&cost+food
Fast food quality, price higher than TAO, go figure&&&&cost+food
Staff also try too hard and gets annoying&&&&service
I can't say from my experience that I understand the mediocre reviews for Khotan&&&&ambience+food
My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed our meal&&&&ambience
lettuce wraps, edamame (ok, they're Japaneze), lobster curry and sweet&sour chicken, all of which were fresh and tasty&&&&ambience+food
It is not that expensive, we paid approaching twice the price at Jasmine two nights before for a similar quality meal&&&&cost+food
Like several other reviewers, I went to Khotan because a friend had a Groupon and we of course waited until the last minute to use it&&&&ambience+food
It really looked like a Panda Express menu with such exotic choices as sweet and sour chicken, orange chicken, and beef and broccoli&&&&food
tic, Khotan is not&&&&ambience+food
But, hey, it's food and we had a coupon&&&&food
The decor inside is really wonderful, with really interesting jade statues, ivory carvings, and a wall of gold, vault-like boxes&&&&ambience
We were seated outside and it was  a nice night&&&&food
We ordered Khotan lobster, chicken lo mein, brown rice, and a tempura platter&&&&ambience+food+service
The sauce in the Khotan lobster is great,&&&&ambience+food
The chicken lo mein was "eh," very boring and the chicken was slightly overcooked&&&&ambience+food
The tempura platter was delicious&&&&food
anything fried always is&&&&food
I'm conflicted because I generally liked the execution, food, and service,&&&&food+service
If you want expensive Panda Express-esque food with a strip view, however, this is your place&&&&food
We stumbled upon khotan by pure laziness&&&&ambience+food
not kid friendly anymore) and gambled a little before we started getting some hunger pangs&&&&service
So we wandered a little bit and saw the downstairs opening for this place&&&&ambience+service
greeted by another host and seated in the bar area since it was a quiet sunday night&&&&ambience+food
We just needed a few bites to eat so we could make our flight without starving&&&&ambience+food
we shared chicken lollipops (not bad), kobe sliders (looked dry&&&&food
were actually moist), gai lan side dish (cant go wrong w/ veggies) and a noodle dish (don't remember which&&&&food
it was dry dry dry and super chewy/tough rice noodles&&&&food
It was just a spot we ended up at due to convenience of it's location&&&&ambience
Food was good&&&&food
The restaurant was pretty slick, great atmosphere and a really cool patio&&&&food
If you happen to go for dinner the pirate show is pretty cool since you are watching it from the back side of the boats&&&&cost
tery and apps were spot on&&&&ambience
The drinks were great, and my ginger mojito was really refreshing after a long day on my feet&&&&ambience+food
The reason this wasn't a 4 star was because my diner was rather salty and not much better than something I would get at my local Chinese take out place&&&&food
The food was so so,&&&&food
the drinks, app and atmosphere were great&&&&food
Worth a visit and they frequently have Groupons and happy hour specials&&&&cost
We sat at a table on the patio to watch the 8pm Sirens show&&&&ambience
- nice patio with misters and adequate seating&&&&food
I won't rate this place according to the show&&&&cost
)- decent variety of food selections and full bar- decor and ambience were pretty niceCons&&&&ambience+food
- food was overpriced for the quality&&&&cost+food
I had the Teriyaki chicken, which was dry&&&&food
California Roll appetizer was dry and fell apart&&&&food
We ordered a lot of food and were really underwhelmed&&&&food+service
- service was uninspired and our waitress looked really annoyed to have to walk to our table, which was located a bit out of the way&&&&ambience+food+service
She disappeared for a bit while we ate and my husband had to go to the kitchen to get more soy sauce&&&&food
We eventually had to call out the Mgr to ask for service, and things got better after that&&&&food+service
Without the Groupon, we would have spent the $200 elsewhere and received much better quality food and service&&&&food+service
I suppose it might be worth it to come and try the lounge area during happy hour&&&&cost
I ate at Khotan tonight with my husband, sister-in-law and her husband&&&&ambience+food
The service was really good&&&&food+service
So was the lighting&&&&ambience
We ordered the sliders, Tom Yum with chicken and the crispy asparagus to start&&&&food+service
The sliders were pretty darn tasty with a side of pickled ginger that our server recommended&&&&food
The asparagus came out ice cold&&&&ambience+food
They brought us another one,&&&&ambience
it still wasn't great hot&&&&ambience+food
We all agreed that they use Rice Krispies for the "fry&&&&food
"For dinner, we ordered the Pad Thai (awesome), Khotan beef (decent), and crispy walnut shrimp&&&&ambience+food+service
All of us like walnut shrimp from Ping Pang Pong and China Mama&&&&food
We were expecting it to be hot&&&&ambience+food
It was cold&&&&ambience+food
Apparently, that's the way they serve this dish - fried cold shrimp&&&&ambience+food
Once we knew, it wasn't that bad on the bed of vinegary salad&&&&food
Our dessert of mini-cupcakes was comped&&&&ambience+food
The worst cupcakes I've ever had&&&&ambience+food
Three cupcakes - mango, coconut and chocolate, each with their own sauce&&&&ambience+food
They didn't taste fresh and were too cold&&&&ambience+food
The cake wasn't fluffy and was really dense&&&&food
Worth a try&&&&cost
Then she told us to go upstairs because that's where the real restaurant is at and we were again greeted by another Asian hostess&&&&ambience
While walking upstairs, you would feel like you're in a bank's safe box room because seriously, that's what it looks like, no joke&&&&ambience
Am I missing some sort of cultural significance here? The place is dark with small tables, chairs and booths&&&&ambience
It took them ten minutes to hand us the menus after being seated which I thought was incredibly appalling because I'm sure they didn't forget about us&&&&food
They have candles on the tables which made it kinda uncomfortable because it seemed too romantic for our own goods (We were hungry and randomly walked into this place)&&&&ambience
I ain't gonna lie, the food was good&&&&food
We ordered some noodles which tasted like mixed flavors of Chinese and Italian&&&&food+service
There were just too many selections on the menu (sarcasm) so I ordered an eye roll&&&&service
For more than a dub, it's not worth it&&&&cost
But compared to other rolls I've had at other sushi places, this roll melted in my mouth with just the right amount of flavor, MmmM&&&&cost+food
I liked how our waiter came back to refill my friend's drink a couple times without being asked&&&&food+service
I like staffs who pretends to be genuine as good as they're faking it&&&&service
Having missed our menus for the first ten minutes, the service is above average&&&&food+service
Even if money grew on my orange tree, I wouldn't come here again though&&&&food
The service was poor&&&&food+service
The food is good,&&&&food
Lots of potential here in the front and back of house&&&&ambience
horrible creations that make you think twice about eating there (salmon parmesan roll, crab lo mein Alfredo, wtf?)&&&&food
Terribly expensive and it seemed that the staff didn't care too much about what was going on around them&&&&service
Not worth the money&&&&cost
Bad drinks and equally bad overpriced food&&&&cost+food
The pay roll was bland and possibly the worst I've ever had&&&&cost
It made the $35 roll taste even worse&&&&food
The mongolian beef is better at P F Changs&&&&food
Service was good&&&&food+service
Decor was very nice&&&&ambience+food
Recently ate at Khotan&&&&ambience+food
The food was quite good&&&&food
I had the cashew chicken and my wife had sweet and sour chicken&&&&food
While somewhat expensive, and the service a bit slow, it was a good experience overall especially with the Groupon discount saving us $25&&&&cost+food+service
What the hell was TI thinking?  SH was more Japanese influenced, I would say Khotan is more Chinese influenced, with a Japanese pricetag&&&&ambience+cost+food
*Jalapeno Hamachi, not as&&&&food
tery & fresh as I'm used to, soy overpowered, I liked the battered jalapeno slices, great texture, $22*Rainbow Roll, snow crab & fish were not fresh, $18*Broccoli Beef, liked the Broccoli Rabe aspect, the beef was eh, $24*Gai Lan, cooked nicely, & not too greasy, $6*Crab Lo Mein Alfredo, really strange, like the powdered packet in Hamburger Helper,&&&&ambience+food
oddly comforting, $14This place is pretty pathetic,&&&&ambience
they serve a mean cocktail & boast a great alfresco dining option&&&&food+service
The food wasn't bad&&&&food
Decor is nice, service is average, the bartender was cool though&&&&ambience+food+service
For the price they charge I would pass on this place&&&&cost+food
there's some standards you would expect based on the price and the food just didn't meet the standards in my opinion&&&&cost+food
Food was overpriced&&&&food+cost
Khotan is Closed and "Senor Froggy" resturant&&&&ambience+food+service
I came here back when it was social house, and now Khotan&&&&ambience+food
And I don't mean that in a good way&&&&service
While the decor hasn't really changed much&&&&ambience
I figured regardless of the name changing I'd give it a shot&&&&ambience+food+service
Like I mentioned before the decor is still unique&&&&ambience
Dim, sheik, very Asian like of course&&&&ambience
And the waitresses from what I remember were a lot nicer&&&&food
I ordered a few sushi pieces, with some chicken like kabobs&&&&food+service
I believe a salad&&&&food
Chicken was dry&&&&food
Salad was salad&&&&food
Aside from the overpriced food&&&&cost+food
Anyway if over priced wanna be asian food is your gig&&&&cost+food
Along with half ass service&&&&food+service
Mediocre food&&&&food
I could have had better food at Panda Express&&&&food
The orange peel chicken was cold and lacking flavor&&&&ambience+food
The veggies in the dish tasted like they weren't washed before being cooked&&&&food
You can IGNORE all the complaints regarding price as this restaurant (formerly Social House, and formerly Khotan Pan-Asian Cuisine) now goes by the name of Khotan Asian Bistro and has a NEW menu with lower prices&&&&ambience+cost+food+service
Anyone comparing it to "Panda Express" or even "PF Changs" is simply not doing this place justice&&&&food
The modern and sleek decor hasn't changed too much from the days it was Social House except for the fact they have added some stunning jade and ivory sculptures on display&&&&ambience
Most importantly, the food presentation, taste and service are well beyond expectations for a "reasonably" priced restaurant on the Las Vegas Strip&&&&cost+food+service
Can you get Asian food as good or better at a lower price down the street (Spring Mountain) in Las Vegas Chinatown?  Yes, of course,&&&&cost+food
no where near the same dining experience in terms of location, seating (indoor/outdoor), ambiance, and cool vibe&&&&food
I would challenge some of those that previously rated this place less than 4 to give it another try&&&&cost
Unless you are a complete foodie-snob and/or have no clue what a "normal" price is for a Las Vegas Strip restaurant, it will be difficult to rate this dining experience lower than a 4&&&&cost+food
We went there to celebrate our anniversary&&&&cost
When we called to book a reservation, they asked if it was for a special occasion&&&&ambience
There were lots of staff walking around,&&&&service
The food was ok,&&&&food
not worth the $67 bill for 2 dishes and one drink&&&&cost+food
it's super expensive and the food is so-so for the price you pay&&&&cost+food
It's also super dark, so it's hard to read the menus&&&&ambience
This is probably to hide that you're paying $45 for a few pieces of steak&&&&cost+food
If you're here at the right time, Treasure Island's pirate show will play right outside your window, so you can listen to the cannons and fireworks go off while you're eating a romantic dinner&&&&cost+food
While looking for a restaurant on the strip that had excellent decor and a romantic atmosphere,&&&&ambience
at the same time a reasonable price, i found Khotan&&&&ambience+cost+food
The service was good, our waiter was very social and always kept our drinks filled&&&&food+service
I tried out the orange peel beef and my girlfriend tried out the Khotan beef both were very delicious dishes,&&&&ambience+food
me being a fat ass was still hungry after since there isn't very much in the plate&&&&ambience
Eat out in the patio if you are going to be there at nightfall, Khotan is right above the pirate show at T&&&&ambience+cost+food
Chicken lollipops&&&&food
My four stars are for the lounge area and the food&&&&food
The service in the dining area was lame&&&&food+service
The lounge was great&&&&food
During happy hour (5-7PM) there are drink and app specials&&&&food
And since ISLA was packed to the gills, my fella and I decided to check out Khotan&&&&ambience+food
The barkeep was friendly and chatted us up while we sat and watched an NBA game&&&&ambience+service
We were so pleased with the service and food (spicy tuna roll -- YUM) that we decided to come back a couple hours later for dinner&&&&food+service
The dining area is upstairs&&&&ambience
Getting up there is quite a sight - floor to ceiling gold drawers&&&&food
Once seated (inside) we quickly realized we should have sat on the patio&&&&food
The inside of the restaurant was dark&&&&ambience
Not mood-making-romantic dark&&&&ambience
More like push-that-candle-here-so-I-can-read-the-menu dark&&&&ambience
We ordered a couple entrees (pad thai and singapore style noodles) and a Tom Yum soup&&&&food+service
The soup was super tasty and chocked full of amazingly tender chicken&&&&food
My one gripe about the soup&&&&food
there were pieces of fried scallion (or something&&&&food
I couldn't really see what it was) that was really fiberous and unpleasant to eat&&&&food+service
I ended up picking it out of my soup&&&&food
Super tasty and a really great portion&&&&food
I did raise an eyebrow at the price ($15) -&&&&cost+food
My fella loved the singapore style noodles&&&&food
He would have licked the plate clean if he wasn't so classy&&&&ambience
We enjoyed a two-for-one cocktail with our complimentary voucher from Treasure Island and both opted for the ginger mojito&&&&food
) So - let's talk about the service&&&&food+service
The servers were polite and great when we saw them&&&&food+service
We had four different servers at one point and before any of them could get to our table to take our order, the barkeep came by since we had been sitting (unattended to) for about twenty minutes&&&&ambience+food+service
the servers never acknowledged the crap service&&&&food+service
A simple, "Sorry 'bout the wait" would have sufficed&&&&food
Good thing the food is so good&&&&food
This place was really good when it was Social House, now its just an expensive place to get sub-par food&&&&food
The service was ok,&&&&food+service
the food was over priced and not up to Vegas quality standards&&&&cost+food
The best description I can give about this restaurant is that it is the Panda Express of asian food and not worth the price&&&&cost+food
For appetizer we had the crispy asparagus&&&&food
It was just japanese crackers deepfried around asparagus&&&&food
Too weird of a texture&&&&food
okay to eat&&&&food
So to me, 6 asparagus heads is not worth that price&&&&cost+food
I got the lobster curry&&&&food
Again, for the price, it was not worth&&&&cost+food
i can get thai green curry for $5&&&&food
95 down the street and throw in some steamed lobster and get the same effect&&&&food
a pork chop&&&&food
the place is also really dark, to the point where you cannot read your menu&&&&ambience
you have to put the menu an inch away from the candle on your table&&&&ambience
Best place for fries&&&&food
From the hummus, salads, pasta and pasta sauce&&&&food
The Chicken Shawarma  sandwich is like nothing you have had before&&&&ambience+food
It's juicy, fresh and huge&&&&ambience+food
Great lunch place&&&&food
They stick French fries in it for me&&&&food
Also, the people that work there are very sweet, humble and down right good&&&&food
You walk in and instantly greeted with great service&&&&food+service
On several occasions I have gone into the restaurant in a rush between meetings and they are fast&&&&ambience
I have brought in a few clients with me and they never disappointed with the food&&&&ambience+food
It is family owned and the food is absolutly exquisite&&&&food
They get alot of regulars and have a very loyal clientele&&&&service

Was really good and refreshing and filling&&&&ambience+food
Wonderful spices, excellent quality and care taken&&&&food
Lots of repeat customers are seen at Sami's&&&&food
I love their coleslaw and very fresh ingredients are used&&&&ambience+food
Bring a sweater and leggings/pants with you, because this place is freezing&&&&food
There's something wrong with their ventilation/air-conditioning system&&&&ambience
It might be warmer if you sit next to the grill&&&&ambience
It's a great place to get together with friends, family or colleagues for any group event&&&&food
Children's birthday parties are celebrated a lot here&&&&cost
It's always a fun time with the food cooked in front of you&&&&food
Nice quality and decently healthy&&&&food
Price point is a bit high,&&&&cost+food
It is fun evening with a delicious food and a great presentation&&&&food
) and they were able to accomodate close to 25-30 of us at 2 facing tables&&&&ambience
We had another great performance by a chef and everyone left satisfied&&&&food
Also, the food can be pretty bland if not seasoned perfectly - which has been the case the last couple of times&&&&food
It's also not really that cheap given the portions&&&&cost
Service is pretty decent at the tempenyaki tables - soup, salad and the meal for one price (rice included) for one price and the servers are usually quick to bring out this portion&&&&ambience+cost+food+service
Tempenyaki takes a little bit of time - so do not come in here if you're in a rush - they usually wait to fill up the whole table with small parties&&&&ambience
Great staff, great location and great food&&&&food+service
Great Japanese food&&&&food
I would definitely recommend this restaurant for a date or even a party&&&&ambience
food was delicious and well seasoned and cooked&&&&food
great for small groups&&&&food
Had a great experience here&&&&food
Food was fantastic and a large portion&&&&food
Great time all around&&&&food
bit pricey&&&&cost+food
great for groups&&&&food
Not sure if it's good for dates&&&&food
teriyaki chicken was great&&&&food
Shimps and beef were ok&&&&food
It's just salt-pepper and soy sauce in cooked food&&&&food
No special spices/exotic ingredients&&&&food
3 starts just because it's entertainment else i'd have given this 1 star based on just food&&&&food
Le restaurant est très calme et conviendra pour un bon restaurant entre amis&&&&ambience
Such a cool environment&&&&ambience
its awesome for partys snd the chefs always entertaining the guests I find it a very new york feeling&&&&ambience
The food is great and so are the drinks , we went once for sushi&&&&food
it was great&&&&food
So fresh and clean&&&&ambience+food
It's a really nice restaurant , very similar to benihannas if anyone is interested&&&&food
I ended up getting the jumbo shrimp & it was made to perfection anyone that loves Chinese food would understand---5&&&&food
I was going out to dinner with a client and wanted something good near my hotel&&&&ambience+food
As other Yelpers have mentionned, if you don't come with a large enough group to fill up the whole table, they will seat you with others and you'll have to wait until the whole table is full before the chef will start the show/dinner&&&&ambience+food
Luckily for us, this only took about 15 minutes, in which we had enough time to sample some of their tasty sake&&&&food
Both were very tasty&&&&food
the chef mentioned that I should try the samurai steak next time, as it's his personal favourite (he let me have a little bite and it was delicious)&&&&food
Half way through the dinner, he asked us if anyone was celebrating anything special&&&&ambience
We really had a great evening here&&&&food
It is consistently awesome&&&&ambience
I agree with another reviewer, if you're in a rush, it's not the place for you&&&&ambience
However, more often than not, my fiancé and I are seated at a table alone which is nice&&&&ambience+food
It is one of the only restaurants where my fiancé doesn't need to eat a second meal 30 minutes later&&&&food
Our bill (with tax&&&&cost
This includes a bottle of sake (I order the chicken teriyaki, he orders the shrimp and filet mignon)&&&&food+service
This place is our go-to when we want a filling, casual and awesome meal&&&&ambience
Waited 40mins before chef came to cook for us and only after I went to the manager to complaint&&&&service
Chef quickly came, cooked out meal within 15mins and we were done in the same amount of time&&&&cost+food
Definitely not repeating due to mediocre food with little to no selection&&&&food
The staffed blamed the 40min wait on a 20% filled restaurant on the chef being slow&&&&service
This Bar Restaurant is a wide open airy space within the Apex |International Hotel&&&&ambience+food+service
We booked a table for Fathers Day Lunch&&&&ambience
I have to say the food was excellent, the service was very good & value for money on the Sunay Lunch menu was excellent&&&&food+service
The soup was piping hot, the Roast beef melted in the mouth&&&&ambience+food
Attached to the hotel my parents were staying in, Metro was restaurant of choice for a quick -&&&&ambience+food
Metro is, I admit - a beautiful restaurant, modern, clean and bright&&&&ambience
But my compliments will end there&&&&food
The meals were expensive, somewhat tasteless, tiny and my soup starter left an odd coating in my mouth for the rest of the meal&&&&food
The staff were rude and unhelpful, bearly conceling thier bordom and hate for thier jobs&&&&service
Service was so slow that I counted my dad checking his watch more than once with fear for missing the plane in two hours time&&&&food+service
still, it was an awful experience which I will not want to repeat&&&&food
Food was nice, a bit pricey though, I had Orzo pasta, sun blushed tomato, rocket, parmesan & pine nuts, the pesto on it could've had less oil on it as I found quite greasy even for a pesto based sauce&&&&ambience+cost+food
It came with a nice salad so this was a good surprise&&&&food
We had a nice rose wine and service was alright&&&&food+service
There are typical food court choices&&&&food
The seating area is nice, and they clean it up very regularly&&&&ambience+food
It's a food court&&&&food
If you have to eat here, I'm sure you'll be able to find something in your budget and to your taste&&&&food
Seeing as there are reviews for Dine on L3 (Yorkdale mall) and Urban Eatery (Eaton Centre), I figure I would review the new food court in Square One which is going by the name of "Food Central"&&&&food
It has the same concept as Yorkdale and Eaton Centre, as they give you real cutlery and dishes as opposed to the plastic ones&&&&food
Compared to Eaton Centre, and Yorkdale, this is a lot smaller,&&&&food
there is still at least 20 places to choose from including some of the newer entries into the food court wars (Big Smoke Burger, Amaya Express, SU&SHI, Shanghai 360, Chipolte, Szechuan Express) plus the older ones (A&W, KFC, Manchu Work etc&&&&food
Overall, it's not a bad place to eat if you are on your lunch, can't decide what to eat or are just hanging out at the mall,&&&&food
not worth a special drive (it is a food court after all right?)Also, compared to Yorkdale, there's no special sit down restaurants close to the food court besides Earl's&&&&cost+food
Although I appreciate Square One trying to improve shoppers' dining experience, what I dislike about the whole concept behind Food Central is that it sorta promotes an apathetic, lazy attitude amongst diners&&&&food
Use of actual stainless steal cutlery, melamine trays, bowls, cute condiment containers, cups, etc&&&&ambience+food
Newly renovated eateries, washrooms, seating&&&&food
Not enough seating, especially at peak times, considering the amount of eateries, and there aren't any visible garbage/recycling bins, so as a diner, you can either leave your tray/trash on the tables OR bring your tray to the station to have someone else clean up after you&&&&ambience+cost+food
Instead, I think Food Central should promote a more community-like attitude such as "please clean up after yourself" and set up different bins - similar to IKEA/Whole Foods - so that everyone can do their part&&&&ambience+food
As of now, Food Central is not 100% complete, still uneven flooring around outskirts&&&&food
Much more nicer than before&&&&food
Much nicer than the old food court that I remember, that's for sure&&&&food
I worked at Square One for several years back when I was in university and remember the food court quite well&&&&food
Now with a lot of malls stepping up their game, it's nice to see that Square One has followed suit&&&&food
Everything has been redone and renovated and it has a nice and modern look, although it does look a little cold and sterile compared with how it used to&&&&ambience+food
It's still overpriced and often dull mall food&&&&ambience+cost+food
They've also made the switch to reusable cutlery and dishware, which is obviously great&&&&food
All-in-all it's still a food court in a mall,&&&&food
at least it's a pretty decent one with a lot of choices&&&&food
Though I don't work in the mall anymore, nor do I frequent it as much as I used to it's nice to know that if I did, I wouldn't get too sick of having to go through a very limited rotation&&&&ambience+food
This is a typical mall food court, mediocre food over priced, bad attitude = Square one food central---3&&&&cost+food
The service was friendly and attentive without being intrusive--an ideal balance&&&&food+service
The friend I met for dinner here had been here many times before and usually ordered the meat dinner for two&&&&food+service
We decided to try the vegetarian version this time&&&&food
The dhal was fabulous, as was the saag paneer&&&&food
Fresh naan and thick, not too sweet lassi&&&&ambience+food
not overly sweet&&&&food
In all, a delicious meal&&&&food
We lucked out in being seated without a reservation,&&&&food
the waiter seemed a little nonplussed at first, and we had an option of one of two tables, as all of the rest of them were reserved&&&&ambience+service
My one regret is that the dinner special was so enticing--and delicious, and filling--that I never got a chance to try the other tempting options on the menu&&&&food
I'd like to put a good word in for their mango lassi, too&&&&food
This place is great - nice food, not very expensive, usually easy to get a table, a nice mix of vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes&&&&ambience+food
The service can be a little inattentive, though -&&&&food+service
they are very friendly and helpful, you just need to know that if you want something you need to wave someone over&&&&service
i had fairly high hopes for this place based on the yelp reviews id perused so i was very let down when it turned out that i had been mislead&&&&ambience
the decor , if trying a little too hard to create a "fine-dining" type of atmosphere , is pleasant and i really liked the artwork on the walls featuring the nepalese (or indian ?) countryside&&&&ambience+food
the music was also nice traditional indian music&&&&ambience+food
were kind , polite and attentive&&&&service
after waiting quite a while in an empty restaurant to receive our order , we thought that maybe this was a good sign as some of our meal was being prepared "fresh"&&&&ambience+food+service
sadly this was not the case except maybe for the bindi masala which was slimy and undercooked&&&&ambience+food
the aloo gobi featured very hard cauliflower and stale tasting , dried out potatoes&&&&ambience+food
ter chicken which was VERY tough and dry&&&&food
the sauce was not rich at all - definitely couldnt detect any&&&&food
ter and very little cream&&&&food
the tomatoes didnt lend any sweetness as they should&&&&ambience+food
instead made the dish quite bitter&&&&food
the naan was okay&&&&food
if we hadnt had a discount through groupon , it would have felt like a complete rip-off&&&&ambience+cost
the potions were VERY tiny and all four members of our party left very dissatisfied&&&&ambience
maybe this place is earning high praise from people who have little experience with indian food or what torontos competitive dining scene really has to offer ?---2&&&&food
Pretty good nepalese food&&&&food
they also have a lunch only buffet that looks like it's worth checking out&&&&cost
There's an extensive tandoori portion of the menu which looks very interesting&&&&food
Good quick service and all of the chicken dishes were fantastic&&&&food+service
ter chicken is the piece de resistance&&&&food
Come for lunch for a $10 buffet and enjoy an endless supply of their amazing rice pudding and naan,&&&&food+service
ter chicken has lots of bones while the dinner a la carte&&&&food
ter chicken is made with boneless chicken breast&&&&food
Jan 15, 2011 Enjoyed a great meal with friends&&&&food
The place was crowded and we waited 10 minutes (around 8 pm) My partner enjoyed the Chicken vindaloo&&&&ambience+food
way too spicy for me,&&&&food
ter chicken was one of the best I have had and the lamb saag was perfectly balanced&&&&food
Don't bother with the appetizers, just order extra naan or other type of bread&&&&food+service
Prices are decent the service impeccable&&&&cost+food+service
delicious well-priced food with an awesome location on bloor streetshared several with five people, had saag lamb- amazing, very tender and perfectly cooked lamb chicken jalfrezi- excellent level of spice vegetable tandoori- great dish for sharing, comes steaming hot with a huge variety of vegetables and paneer, my fav things to order here shrimp jalfrezi- just as good at the chicken jalfrezibhuteko cali- traditional vegetable dish from nepal, very well seasoned, reminded me of my travels in the Kathmandu Valley&&&&ambience+cost+food+service
yes service is slow&&&&food+service
I have been to Nepal and service is WAY slower (they make everything from scratch and multiple orders means long waits) in that country so it's a very traditional laid back dining atmosphere---5&&&&food+service
The flavours are rich and vibrant, with all the spices and herbs tingling every taste bud&&&&food
Everything is reasonably priced so there's no fear of feasting on wanky food for two hours only to have to go to Pizza Pizza afterwards&&&&cost+food
The service is great, the decor is contemporary and the food is superb&&&&ambience+food+service
I highly recommend the Aloo Tama Bodi, Chicken Momos, the Lamb Vindaloo, Panir Tikka and the Chicken Tikka Masala&&&&food
Some of the best dining service I've had and the food is unique and of high quality&&&&food+service
Amazing foodGreat serviceReasonably priced buffet&&&&cost+food+service
Amazing Indian Food&&&&food
ordered the vegetarian meal for two and was very impressed with everything-- the vegetables were delicious, the saag paneer is the best I have ever tasted and the Naan is so fresh and tasty&&&&ambience+food+service
Great service + great food= happy customer&&&&food+service
-the food is foul&&&&ambience+food
old leftovers- overpicked and not delicious&&&&food
-the bread is stale-the selection is slightly pathetic compared to the queen street row of indian AYCE lunch buffets&&&&ambience+food
On food alone, I would have rated 2 stars because it all seemed a little old at that point (like it had been out for a while),&&&&cost+food
The rest of the experience was great, though - it was a cheap meal, it was fast (I was alone, eating on my way to a meeting) and the service was unobtrusive&&&&cost+food+service
My water was always full and I had as much naan as I wanted&&&&food
a lady at a nearby table was complaining that the food was all too spicy&&&&ambience+food
I am pretty spice-averse, and found everything to have heat&&&&food
So, if you're like that lady and have a zero spice tolerance, beware&&&&food
Maybe don't eat indian food though, you know?---3&&&&food
Went here for dinner on a weekday and the live music was great, makes the experience much more enjoyable&&&&ambience+food
The service was good and not too over-the-top&&&&food+service
We loved the curry chicken, the garlic naan was good too,&&&&food
I prefer regular naan&&&&food
Their spicy shrimp was very flavourful&&&&food
The portions are much smaller than what I am used to at other Indian places though and it's a bit pricey too&&&&cost+food
Overall, it was great though, I'd come back&&&&food
The food was delicious&&&&food
I had a vegetarian homemade cottage cheese + creamy tomato mix&&&&ambience+food
regardless it was fantastic&&&&service
My boyfriend ordered some sort of chicken, which was extremely tender and juicy&&&&food+service
One down side is that in comparison to the ambiance and portions, the price was a bit too expensive&&&&cost+food
Our dinner was one order of each rice, naan, the chicken, and the tomato&&&&ambience+food+service
Not cheap at all&&&&cost
I wish it was a bit cheaper&&&&cost
( The vegetarian dish was $12 before tax&&&&food
Which is normally the price of a  chicken someplace else)Service was good, the food came out pretty quickly&&&&cost+food+service
The food was good and have and I have no complaints&&&&food
I was hoping for food that differentiated itself a bit more from Indian and that's why I'm only giving it 3 stars&&&&food
I've been to Mt Everest countless times over the years for their cheap buffet lunch (believe it costs $10&&&&cost
I find the menu slightly overpriced&&&&ambience+cost+food
Most of the curries were $15 and that did not include rice or naan&&&&food
Given this is the ANNEX and the decor/ambiance of this place is quite underwhelming, I think they are overcharging by a few dollars&&&&ambience
Other similar type places with much better food (Banjara) have a more reasonable price point&&&&cost+food
My date and I ordered the Dinner for Two special ($36&&&&service
You get a platter of tandoori chicken, boti kabob and chicken tikka (two pieces of each), a lamb curry, mutter paneer, peas pulav and 1 order of rice and 1 naan&&&&food+service
Some kind of rice pudding for dessert too&&&&food
Food was pretty tasty, didn't blow my mind&&&&food
Service was bothersome for me - very spotty at this place&&&&ambience+food+service
At times they were over topping off water every 5 minutes, and at other times we could not flag them down to get extra rice or the bill, etc&&&&cost+food
Lunch buffet is still a great option&&&&food
The food here is very good, and the service is exceptional&&&&food+service
There is a wide variety of foods, from vegetarian to meat dishes and non-spicy to spicy ones&&&&food
The Naan, though seemingly pricey, is very good and big&&&&cost+food
The food comes relatively quicky, and despite the relatively small portions, they are actually very rich and filling&&&&food
Ok, everyone else who has commented here needs to calm down a little bit&&&&ambience
Yes, this restaurant is nice,&&&&food
5 stars?I split a non-vegetarian combo for 2 with my girlfriend and it was delicious&&&&food
In particular, the chicken from the tandoor was uncharacteristically juicy&&&&food
Typically, Indian restaurants dry the crap out of their chicken when they put it in the tandoor, and this is the strongest point in favour of this restaurant getting 4 stars&&&&food
There was just something about that scenario that screamed "We're throwing the South Asian kitchen sink at you, what more could you want?  We have a sitar, Indian food, an inexpensive lunchtime buffet and waiters wearing bowties&&&&food+service
"Don't get me wrong, I'd come back here in a second, especially to order more stuff from the tandoor or the delicious mataar paneer,&&&&ambience+food+service
What a very nice place at Bloor Street west&&&&food
You can have a nice buffet with a great selection of Indian food or you can order from the menu&&&&food+service
I recommend the garlic naan and the mango lassi&&&&food
The restaurant sits on the south side of Bloor Street with glass windows looking out onto the street&&&&ambience
There is a bar when you enter that separates a section of tables at the front and some near the kitchen&&&&ambience+cost
The decor is dark and rich with lots of wood accents&&&&ambience
The staff was attentive and polite providing service when needed&&&&food+service
The menu featured a selection of expected East-Indian and Nepalese dishes&&&&food
We opted for some onion bhajis, a roti, a garlic naan, and two vindaloos&&&&food
Although the bhajis were a little greasy and too salt everything else was delicious&&&&ambience+food
I love the vegetarian combo, and the Chana Masala, and the Aloo Gobi&&&&food
The servers are all extremely kind and friendly&&&&service
If you order a complicated dish, it may take more time to come out of the kitchen--&&&&service
Great neighborhood Indian joint&&&&food
Can't beat the takeout student special - 2 (smaller size) dishes, rice, naan/roti, salad, raita, and a beverage for $10&&&&food
They've clearly put in effort to make the place not look as tacky as the proverbial south asian restaurant, and for that I commend them&&&&ambience
The food is not bad per se,&&&&food
it's pretty generic and forgettable&&&&ambience
our server told us that the only difference between Bhuteko Cauli (Nepali Entree) and Aloo Ghobi (Indian Entree) was that the latter had potatoes in it&&&&ambience+food
to make the dishes taste the same is a bit ridiculous&&&&food
They think that since no single table is going to order both the Nepali and Indian equivalents together, they can get away with making cosmetic changes to their dishes&&&&ambience+service
We ordered  Keema Samosas,  and the Nepalese Entrees&&&&service
Aloo Tama Bodi (potatoes, lentils and bamboo shoots) and Khasi Ko Masu (goat meat with bone) and Ras Malai for dessert&&&&ambience+food
The food was freshly prepared and piping hot&&&&ambience+food
The Aloo Tama Bodi was quite bland and the Goat Meat curry tasted like generic Indian  goat curry&&&&food
I was quite interested in the Aloo Tama Bodi primarily for the bamboo shoots and was saddened to see limp, noodl-y shoots in the bowl&&&&ambience
delicately sweet, milky and cool&&&&ambience+food
The service was good except that they mixed up our order,&&&&food+service
I'd have liked them to put more effort in their food than their decor&&&&ambience+food
i ordered for pick up and got the daal and mountain potatoes&&&&ambience+food+service
both dishes were excellent, really quite tasty&&&&food
what i'm not impressed with is the prices -- it's just hard for me to fathom such prices for a small amount of desi food&&&&cost+food
While the service was very good and the decor was passable, the food at Mt&&&&ambience+food+service
While the lunch buffet only cost $9&&&&cost
99, the food was very, very average&&&&food
There were two meat dished, a few vegetarian dishes, and a small salad bar, so there was some variety,&&&&ambience+food
The meat dishes were dry and cooked carelessly - the pieces of chicken looked like they'd been hacked at - and the veggies at the salad bar were dry and looked rather waxy&&&&ambience+food
The only good dishes were the vegetarian ones, and while they tasted okay, it didn't feel like much care had been taken in their preparation&&&&food
Dinner, while much better, also came with a much steeper price tag&&&&cost+food
An order of tikka masala, rice, and naan set me back $16, and the portions of tikka masala and rice were truly very small for the price tag&&&&cost+food+service
The food wasn't bad,&&&&food
it wasn't great either&&&&food
There is tastier Indian food out there, and in larger portions too&&&&food
As I paid 20 dollars and left hungry&&&&cost
99 lunch buffet, and thought everything was quite tasty and high-quality&&&&food
Flavorful with mild hotness&&&&ambience+food
My only complaint was the number of small bones in the goat curry -- had to carefully chew to avoid hitting the many pieces of bone&&&&food
It's been a few years since I last tasted the food from here&&&&food
We didn't feel like going out the other day so we ordered for delivery&&&&service
The came right away and everything was delicious&&&&food
)Their Naan bread is to die for&&&&food
it was a Northern Indian specialty with ginger and a blend of unique spices&&&&food
The place is nice and quiet and the servers were friendly and efficient&&&&ambience+food+service
I hope my  fiancée's friends from Toronto get married so we can eat at this restaurant again---5&&&&food
Whether you want to get the $10 lunch buffet (such a good deal) or a night with a fine dining atmosphere without the fine dining price tag, this is for you&&&&cost+food
Their food is excellent, really - especially during dinner time&&&&food
Service is impeccable (they seriously make you feel like you're at a restaurant that would charge double the price) and prices are very reasonable&&&&cost+food+service
The food at the lunch buffet is most likely just extra leftovers from the previous night so the tandoori chicken won't be as juicy and the naan not as fluffy/warm,&&&&ambience+food
the curry is just as good&&&&food
Try the Lamb Vindaloo (very spicy) or the Chicken Korma&&&&food
The decor is clean and pleasant and we were greeted as soon as we came in&&&&ambience
After our orders were taken, it took quite a while for our food to arrive and we were starting to get jittery&&&&food+service
it was not clear why it took over 35 minutes&&&&ambience+food
All i can say is that the wait was worthwhile, the food was very good&&&&cost+food
Tandoori veggies, lamb tikka, hunters platter, chicken masala, everything was hot and tasty, spiced just right&&&&ambience+food
The sauce and yoghurt marinade were balanced and just right&&&&food
What we appreciated the most was the quality of the lamb and other meats&&&&food
high quality food&&&&food
at the cost of poor service (Refer to bottom of this review)&&&&cost+food+service
Within a matter of days, I was surprised to have received an extremely apologetic response via Yelp from the owners of Mt&&&&ambience
They apologized for the inconvenience they may have caused my party, informed me that the staff was briefed about the situation and that new staff has been consequently hired, and offered me a coupon for my friends and me&&&&ambience+service
Although I have yet to go back (I'm pretty sure I would despite the disappointing service I faced the second time I went), I have decided to up the rating for the restaurant because I am entirely impressed by the fact that the restaurant owners are both concerned with and responsive to the opinions of their customers&&&&food+service
As they had promised, the service was much improved--the service was fast and the meal was as expected delicious&&&&food+service
I'm pretty sure they were unaware that I had previously complained on yelp about their terrible service, so I'm hoping that my experience was unbiased&&&&food+service
With their improved service and same excellent quality of food, I am changing my review to five stars&&&&food+service
The Food is amazing--both lunch buffet and dinner menu2&&&&food
The food is even better when the service isn't terribly slow&&&&food+service
After the first visit to Mt Everest for lunch buffet, I was utterly blown away by the quality of the food&&&&food
We waited an hour and change for our orders to materialize&&&&ambience+service
Unacceptably slow service&&&&food+service
They do Indian and Nepali, which is a great combo since I haven't had too much exposure to Nepali food yet, and I've discovered that I love it&&&&food
The lunch buffet isn't the cheapest ever,&&&&cost
it's all-you-can-eat, so skip breakfast&&&&food
They are a lot more careful with food preparation for dinner (i&&&&food
meat is boneless, selection is better)&&&&food
you know what?  I get the lunch buffet anyway, since it's just so tasty&&&&food
We never manage to spend under $50, which is a shame since I'd like to incorporate this restaurant into daily life&&&&cost+food
However, for a treat, this place is definitely classier than its price range specifies&&&&cost+food
Friendly, undervalued/underrated, tasty, and tasteful&&&&cost+food+service
after ordering takeout, I am not impressed&&&&service
Okra is my favourite vegetable when it comes to Indian cuisine and I order it whenever I can&&&&ambience+service
Mt Everest's bhindi masala over some uninspired rice left me satisfied (it's actually way better as reheated leftovers) and I enjoyed the nice spicy kick to it,&&&&food
the garlic naan was flat out disappointing&&&&ambience+food
I'm a bit of a garlic naan connoisseur and I am not quite sure what to even say about what I tried because there was not much to it&&&&food
It wasn't garlicky in the slightest, not even&&&&ambience+food
tery, and the naan's texture was dry, tasteless, and chewy in an unflattering way&&&&ambience+food
I am for sure willing to give Mt Everest a second shot because I walk past it all the time and would really like to try some of their other items,&&&&ambience+food
first I need to recover from this meal that cost over $30 (two entrees, rice, and naan - really?) and a bit of an upset stomach&&&&cost+food
Been here a few times for dinner, and every time I've been happy with the service and quality of the food&&&&food+service
Me and my friend wanted to dine on some Indian food over a movie&&&&food

The delivery was done in 30 minutes which is very good when compared to delivery times of other Indian restaurants&&&&food

We wouldn't have cared much if only the gravy tasted good&&&&food

The Naan was a horror story&&&&food
It wasn't cooked well&&&&food
I could taste the raw flour which made them inedible for us&&&&food
Apart from that, the naan smelled very bad&&&&ambience+food
We had to throw out the naan and ate the&&&&food
ter chicken with bread&&&&food
I am a self-confessed foodie, and so I'll explain why this much looked-forward-to event turned into the worst nightmare&&&&food
This restaurant has the most horrible customer service that you can imagine&&&&food+service
Me and a friend went over in the early part of the evening and resto was already pretty crowded&&&&ambience
One of the servers sat us down at a 'waiting' table in the front and said the table would be ready in about 20 minutes&&&&ambience+food
35 minutes went by, the waiting area was getting pretty crowded&&&&ambience+food
My friend went and found the guy and asked him for an update 'only 5 minutes sir&&&&food
Meanwhile, even those waiting after of us were seated&&&&food+service
We managed to find the floor manager who looked surprised that we'd been waiting for 1 hour plus&&&&service
we waited for him to add the words 'on the house' or at least a measly 'at a discount'&&&&cost
We left the resto hungry, tired and with a resolve to tell other foodies like us about how LITTLE THEY CARE FOR THE CUSTOMER&&&&food
Oh and btw- you get seated first if you're white&&&&food
Delicious Naan bread and whatever else we had was good too&&&&food
My friend ordered in Nepalese so I have no idea what the dishes were,&&&&service
they were sufficiently spicy and easily mopped up with the bread, which was hot and freshly made&&&&ambience+food
I think one of the appetizers was called Momo, it reminded me of dim sum&&&&ambience
com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Momo-With-Sauce&&&&food
Price was reasonable&&&&cost+food
this is a nice spacious restaurant with low lighting and simple&&&&ambience+food
nice decor, nothing all that memorable,&&&&ambience+food
clean nonetheless&&&&ambience
we ordered the Non-Vegetarian Bhojan for two and to start we ordered the chicken momos&&&&food+service
so we had a mixture of indian and nepalese food&&&&food
they dough was cooked well (maybe slightly overdone,&&&&ambience+food
if so just barely) so that it was soft and not overly chewy&&&&ambience+food
the filling inside was tender pieces of chicken and spinach i think&&&&food
that was very tangy, like it had soup inside or something&&&&food
the waiter brought us one part of a our Bhojan&&&&ambience+service
that had a couple different kinds of chicken, like the tandoori, some boti kebab - which might have been beef or lamb, not sure&&&&food
the chicken was surprisingly tender and tasty in both forms&&&&food
the lamb/beef both in its form here and in the lamb curry to follow were overdone and too chewy, too rubbery&&&&food
what was to follow was the lamb curry, the mutter paneer, a raita and a couple of rice puddings for desert&&&&food
the sauces were pretty great, the accompanying veggies (though not substantial) were tasty, as they had absorbed the juices and accompanying sauces and spices of the meats&&&&food
the rice puddings were fine, tasty,&&&&food
all that was accompanied by 2 kingfisher beers a piece&&&&food
The food is undoubtedly very, very good and perhaps the best Indian food I've had in Toronto so far&&&&food
But it is overpriced&&&&cost+food
I must comment that I disliked the service&&&&food+service
One of the waiters was particularly rude, which comes as no surprise since Indians lack any semblance of tact (being Indian, I'm allowed to say that)&&&&service
Ordered the Fish Pakora, and Shrimp Masala with Naan&&&&food+service
It took about 30-40 minutes for my entree to arrive, and what's worse, is they got my order wrong&&&&food+service
After they did so however, one of the servers questioned whether I had indeed ordered that&&&&service
On the other hand, they did rectify the order immediately, and apologized for the mixup Everything I ordered was delicious&&&&food+service
I recommend getting the Shrimp Masala&&&&food
Tonight, my husband and I ventured in, wanting to try something new out and let me just say, words cannot express how utterly delicious tasting the food is here&&&&food
We selected the dinner for two and had plenty to eat, in fact, we overate, ensuring that there were no left overs&&&&cost+food
We ended our meal with AMAZING mango juice&&&&food
it was well worth it&&&&cost
I have tried a ton of Indian food&&&&food
never had the pleasure to Nepalese so I was instantly excited to try out this place&&&&ambience
The decor was nice and understated&&&&ambience+food
Waiters were super attendant and polite&&&&service
What we ordered&&&&service
MomosJhane ko dalAloo tama bodiLamb BriyaniRaitaWhen asked how hot - we selected medium&&&&ambience+food
Im not a fan of super hot - I much prefer deep rich flavour&&&&ambience+food
We were assured that medium would be the right selection (mild - too bland, and hot would have too much heat)&&&&ambience+food
The medium was perfect - deep rich flavours and just a hint of warmth which is perfect on a cold day&&&&ambience+food
The food itself was cooked to perfection&&&&food
The lamb was cooked enough to be "cooked"&&&&food
Aloo tami bodi was a potato dish with bamboo and black-eyed peas in a rich yummy sauce&&&&ambience+food
The momos came with a lentil mustard sauce that my companion ate with a spoon (it was that good)&&&&food
Even with many alcoholic drinks the final tally was quite inexpensive&&&&food
I give it 4 stars only because I have no base of reference to know if this is the best of the best of Nepalese food -&&&&food
The buffet is great, hard to go wrong with that&&&&food
From the menu, my favourite item is the tandoori lamb skewers&&&&food
Very flavourful, a lovely hint of onions and spices&&&&food
Staff have been reasonably friendly&&&&service
I order the chicken vindaloo, because I wanted something pretty spicy&&&&food+service
The waiter warned us the dish was very spicy,&&&&food+service
we said that is great -- just what we are looking for&&&&food
However, the dish wasn't very spicy at all, I was disappointed&&&&food
The palak paneer was strange, shreds of spanish instead of puree&&&&food
The chicken hariyali on the other hand was excellent -- best dish out of the night&&&&food
My friend and I split the meat bhojan for two&&&&food
(Delicious and far better than Roti Cuisine - though rotis shouldn't really be compared with real restaurant style food)&&&&food
The tandoori chicken hit all the right notes - I could taste the hint of lime from the marinade&&&&food
The bill wasn't bad&&&&cost
The meat bhojan was 38, the wine was probably another $30 - 40, and somehow our total was just over a hundred&&&&food
Ambience-Liked the music in the background&&&&ambience
Service-The service was attentive and friendly&&&&food+service
It does take them some time to bring you the food so it's good to keep that in mind if you're really hungry&&&&food
We ordered the following&&&&service
Naan breadButter ChickenChicken Tandoori-nice and hot as it was served on a sizzling hot place&&&&ambience+food
Basmatic riceLamb Gosht recommended by the host-I found a lot of the pieces to be dried&&&&ambience+food
Perhaps the leg of lamb would have been better&&&&food
ter chicken and chicken tandoori&&&&food
I didn't try the naan&&&&food
I would probably skip this place in the future and go to Little India for lunch buffet instead&&&&food
I've been to Mt Everest twice and I left quite happy both times&&&&food
The service is excellent and the flavours memorable&&&&food+service
I went with three other people and ordered the typical&&&&service
ter chicken, lamb vindaloo, garlic naan and a vegetarian dish with spinach, i forget the name&&&&food
Normally, after eating Indian cuisine, I am usually ready for a nap&&&&food
After eating here, I still felt quite alive&&&&food
There didn't appear to be a layer of oil on the top which I find with some other places&&&&food
at Mt Everest, it still tasted fantastic&&&&food
Medium was the right amount of spice&&&&cost+food
Good food and the best-looking waiters in Toronto&&&&food+service
The only Nepalese resto in town (used to be, haven't heard of any others opening) - so it's interesting to compare the flavours to some of the north Indian tastes in Little India&&&&food+service
Stay away from the stinky traditional Nepalese thing in the veggie combo - even some of the waiters say they can't stand the taste/smell - kinda like you imagine sweaty sneakers would taste&&&&ambience+food+service
Overall, a really nice addition to the Annex when it opened&&&&food+service
Still a reliable place for a pleasant meal in a clean resto&&&&ambience
If you've never had Nepalese food, it is a bit of a must do&&&&food
Like, seriously best Indian food ever&&&&food
The server was AWESOME&&&&ambience
My girlfriend had never eaten indian food in her life and she was quite scared of the "spicy"&&&&food
We got the Butter Chicken and the Chicken Tikki Masala (the server said the chef LOVES to make the Tiki Masala) and shared the rice and naan&&&&food
While the Butter Chicken was good, the Tikki Masala really did take the cake as just incredible&&&&food
would certainly be a great bonus to go on the night's they're playing there&&&&food
After realizing Nepalese food is kind of like Indian food,&&&&food
Headed down for a date dinner before a show at the Bloor Theatre&&&&food
by the end of the night all the good tables were full&&&&ambience
Watch where they seat you, he may just be on break and&&&&food
when the party gets started up again, boy are you in for a ear-ful&&&&ambience
So, we ordered 2 naan and 2 dishes- the daal-like dish and the spinach dish&&&&food+service
This was way more food than we could have eaten&&&&food
But, considering we were headed to the theatre, didn't take any leftovers anyway&&&&food
But, price wise, the dinner for 2 is an amazing deal&&&&cost+food
If I ever go back, which is likely given our monthly Doc Soup at the Bloor, I'll go for that&&&&food
As others  have said, the vegetarian dinner for 2 includes a beer per person, dessert, naan, rice, and 3 dishes&&&&food
One highlight of the night was the Paneer Naan we picked out&&&&ambience+food
It was like ghee-covered Inidan Pizza&&&&food
Fresh out of the Tandoori oven, I could have finished off 3 of those alone&&&&ambience+food
With the temperature reaching a seasonal low -25 last week, we decided it wisest to order lunch to the office&&&&food+service
I combed the online delivery options available and developed a taste for Indian food&&&&food
I thought a little spice would warm me up - I was starting to feel like Michael Keaton in the unanimously critically acclaimed film, Jack Frost (imdb rating&&&&ambience+food
Based on the positive reviews here for Mt Everest, and being that I've never had Nepalese food before, I pushed to give it a try&&&&food
We only ordered some garlic naan, plain rice, and two entrees&&&&food+service
Aloo Tama Bodi (potatoes, bamboo shoots, and black beans in mountain spices)2&&&&ambience+food
Malai Kofta (Cottage Cheese with vegetables in a cashew sauce)The dishes were both tasty&&&&ambience+food
I really enjoyed the Aloo Tama Bodi's flavour, and the Malai Kofta was also delicious&&&&food
Additionally, I was happy with the amount of Naan and rice we received in a single order&&&&cost+food+service
The ratio of bread or rice needed to cover a dish at Mt Everest is clearly 1&&&&ambience+food
First of all, the Malai Kofta only came with about 3 small cubes of cheese&&&&food
Both dishes came in small, unfilled containers (sadly Instagram deleted our photo evidence) and compared to Indian portions elsewhere (and the price) we were disappointed&&&&ambience+cost+food
I always love the food here&&&&food
dinner here is great too, clearly a little pricier though&&&&ambience+food
Only one friend was disappointed, he ordered the tandoori fish, he said it wasn't very tandoori and the portion was small&&&&food+service
(But it looked the best, arriving on a sizzling plate)  He was lamenting all of this after the meal&&&&ambience
One had the lamb and as another friend of mine did years ago, they both loved it&&&&food
One tried the first chicken option on the menu and he loved it too&&&&food
I had the okra dish, it was so tasty&&&&food
The service was fast, polite and efficient&&&&food+service
The Choyela chicken appetizer was fantastic&&&&food
nice to try a different spice flavor than the usual Indian spices we're now accustomed to&&&&food
Khasi Ko Maasu goat was the Nepalese non-vegetarian entree I went with&&&&food
The menu de-emphasizes meat and lists it second&&&&food
With as imposing a name as Mount Everest, you might think that this Nepalese restaurant would be a place of epic food proportions&&&&food
But instead of table-sagging selections of meat, rice, and heavy sauce, we left here after dining feeling full&&&&ambience+food
It's a good place to come for creative and well-crafted North Indian food that will not leave a mark or make too heavy of an impression&&&&food
The dishes we ordered included a delicious portion of Aloo Tama Bodi ("Potatoes, bamboo shoots, and black-eyed beans cooked with mountain spices&&&&ambience+food+service
") and a vegetarian tasting menu for two&&&&food
The naan was excellent, as other reviewers have mentioned&&&&food
The service was efficient, friendly, and elegant&&&&food+service
It fit well the food that was familiar&&&&food
with a slight variation in presentation, spice, and flavor that made things interesting without being too intense&&&&ambience+food
And that's something to celebrate&&&&cost
ANYhow -this place actually offers REAL service and food that tastes amazing - what a concept&&&&food+service
The naan bread is perfectly fresh and everything we ordered was delicious&&&&ambience+food+service
I can't believe this was the first place I've tried Baingan Bharta (Eggplant Curry)&&&&food
The waitstaff are all friendly and make you feel relaxed&&&&service
Oh - and the bathrooms are sparkling clean&&&&ambience
On peut choisir son niveau de piment, no / small / medium / hot / very hot&&&&ambience+food
Service amical et attentif&&&&food+service
Limiting my meat intake has brought me to fully appreciate a place that does meat justice&&&&ambience+food
And justice Mt&&&&food
Tikka masala tends to be a crowd pleaser, and I'd recommend the appetizer plate if you want to sample&&&&ambience+food
Don't both with rice or dessert, though you may want naan to compensate for the spice&&&&food
And again, although I try to be veg most times, I would say abandon any such intentions here and embrace the perfect succulence that is their meat dishes&&&&food
Not a five though because it's a bit pricey yet fails to pull off the classy act (though it does try&&&&cost+food
Servers also tend to be a bit rude, which I can only ignore when prices are low enough to make me feel like I'm getting away with something&&&&cost+food+service
Nevertheless, I will likely be back again when I am craving meat that is cooked as it should be&&&&food
On weekends, even with a reservation we waited 20 minutes for a table for 2&&&&ambience+food
sat at that table for 10 minutes before even getting a glass of water&&&&ambience+food
the food overall was quite good, from the apps to the mains, this would be a 4 star experience&&&&food
the service was brutal by being both unattentive and slow&&&&food+service
honestly when the glasses on the table are empty, I expect someone to be taking my next drink order asap&&&&ambience+food+service
So because the service is 2/5 and the food is 4/5 I'll give this a 3/5 overall&&&&food+service
Nice north Indian food, good service, pleasant ambience&&&&ambience+food+service
This is an incredible restaurant for a delicious date&&&&food
The vibrant and subtle sauces, spices and flavors take you on a journey beyond the senses&&&&food
Especially if you're a student who eats elsewhere normally, the dinner for two special at about $30 is remarkably filling and memorable&&&&food
My wife had the Matar Paneer and I had one of the chicken dishes&&&&ambience+food
Both of them were  very delicious and well prepared&&&&food
I'm only giving this place a 4 because we had to wait a few extra minutes for the waiter to get our orders&&&&food+service
I was desperately in need of mexican food one day at lunch or else I was going to rip someone's face off&&&&cost+food
Definitely 5 stars for Maria, who I gather owns this place, as she was really nice and inviting&&&&food
I needed to get my food to go, which wasn't a problem and I ordered a carne asade burrito which came with a side of beans and rice - oh I also got a bag of chips and salsa too&&&&food+service
When I finally got to sit down and eat my food it totally appeased the burrito beast inside me&&&&food
There was a lot of food and the rice was delicious too&&&&food
A restaurant can't rely soley on the food&&&&food
As you walk in the decor is neatly situated and the atmosphere gets you excited for some possible good mexican food&&&&ambience+food
No one will greet you at the door and you wonder if you should wait to be sat or just seat yourself&&&&food
With more observation you'll notice a sign far away from the front door saying "Please seat yourself&&&&food
"  So you look for a clean cozy table and seat yourself, which is not a big deal at all&&&&ambience+food
I found out that on two occasions it took upwards to five minutes for them to arrive&&&&food
I am an understanding person , I can see the place is busy,and I love mexican food so I patiently wait with a smile&&&&food
However when each server has over a ten table section and can't get you in and out in a timely manner&&&&ambience
Or maybe change your concept of the restaurant while having customers go to a window and order their food&&&&food+service
I'll remind you that the food is really good,&&&&food
Maria was super nice and inviting&&&&food
5 stars for service and ambiance&&&&food+service
This place was clean&&&&ambience
The rest room was clean&&&&ambience
The chips and salsa were excellent, hot and chunky salsa&&&&ambience+food
I had the two soft taco meal with rice and beans&&&&food
I mixed the tacos one with Chicken and one with Beef&&&&food
The beef was carne asada on two small corn shells&&&&food
The chicken was chopped into cubes and was "day old" at best&&&&food
It was not fresh&&&&ambience+food
The rice was good&&&&food
I have had better, the beans were ok&&&&food
really lacked flavor&&&&food
The "lunch" was about 10 bucks and I felt cheated&&&&food
Yes, sometimes the service can be slow&&&&food+service
If you are looking for THE BEST Mexican Food restaurant in Phoenix, El Conquistador is it&&&&food
The food is consistently outstanding&&&&food
The only reason that I can even begin to imagine as to why reviewers say it's nothing special is because a) they were expecting the typical Mexican food&&&&food
This is Halisco style food - not the same&&&&food
And b) they ordered the chicken tacos&&&&food+service
Subdued lighting with eccentric and rich coloring&&&&ambience
They are friendly and remember you if you go there often enough&&&&service
I swear he's super nice&&&&food
She's so warm and welcoming and knows my order every time I go in&&&&ambience+service
Food (and none of it is greasy&&&&ambience+food
+ Pork chop/cube with green sauce&&&&food
INCREDIBLE&&&&food
+ Chicken tacos&&&&food
+ Chicken tortilla soup&&&&food
It's spicyyy and will clear your sinuses&&&&ambience+food
+ Refried beans&&&&food
The best I've had, and believe me, I am well versed in Mexican food&&&&food
If anyone knows beans, it's me&&&&food
The chips are freshly deep fried, so they're wonderful and crunchy&&&&ambience+food
The salsa is great&&&&food
One is chunky and mildly hot, while the other is super smooth and super hot&&&&ambience+food
Both taste amazing&&&&food
their always-spotless utensils, plates, and tables make me endlessly happy&&&&ambience
I asked if they were open and she said what did the sign say? I said it says open (&&&&service
She finally says there is a large party coming in and to sit in the other room&&&&ambience
Both rooms are fairly small&&&&ambience
The decor is pretty whack&&&&ambience
Old office looking carpet and old booths&&&&ambience+food
Spilled food and drinks just don't come out of carpet and especially old office looking carpet&&&&ambience+food
The tables are covered with that cheap vinyl red sticky covers that also never look or feel clean&&&&ambience+cost
The benches were old and had tears in them&&&&ambience+food
We were brought menus and drinks fairly quickly&&&&ambience+food
Our waitress came back and asked if were ready to order&&&&service
About 15 minutes into our "quick" lunch we were finally given a small bowl of chips and a couple of salsa&&&&ambience+food
We placed our orders and in comes out in about another 10-15 minutes&&&&food+service
Its a pretty large burro filled with a chile relleno, steak picado, and guac&&&&food
50 I expect greatness in a burrito&&&&food
The wife had a bean and cheese burro w/ enchilada sauce&&&&food
They were very tight on the sauce and cheese&&&&food
The waitress came by another 15-20 minutes later and asked how we were&&&&food
She didn't take our plates and she didn't bring our bill&&&&ambience+cost
Another 5-10 minutes goes by and I finally get up and walk to the man at the front and ask him if could pay him directly&&&&cost+food
Our waitress, who's now talking on the phone, with our dirty plates still on our tables and check no where to be found even after I asked for it, makes a statement to the man that I am ready to go&&&&ambience
No b, I was ready to go 20 minutes ago when I told you I was done&&&&food
Now I'm ready for an apron cause I've been here long enough to get paid&&&&cost
Maybe they lost some key staff members&&&&service
I'm giving El Conquistador 4 stars for the food&&&&food
5 stars for the service&&&&food+service
our service was horrible&&&&food+service
I was taking my neighbor out for dinner, and her comment was that "we could have died back here and they wouldn't notice&&&&food
" We waited at least 5 minutes before anyone came over to give us menus or take a drink order&&&&food+service
We tried giving "the eye" or "the nod" and stopped short only of getting up to refill our own drinks during the meal&&&&food
On the plus side, the food was very good and I have been craving it since my initial visit&&&&food
I had a combination plate that let me taste a yummy chili relleno, taco and enchilada -- all were fantastic&&&&ambience+food
My neighbor got the special (seafood enchiladas) and raved about hers as well&&&&food
if the service isn't any better&&&&food+service
Going to have to knock this place down a peg for the bad service&&&&food+service
great food&&&&food
slow and inconsistent service&&&&food+service
Her husband is surly and an incompetent bartender&&&&ambience+food
On two separate visits my wife and sister in-law ordered margaritas, in both instances the husband (not friendly enough to clue you in on his name) "forgot" to put the tequila in the drinks&&&&cost+food+service
The food is great&&&&food
The green chile is my favorite (spicy)&&&&food
I hear that the Chile Relleno is awesome also&&&&ambience
I normally don't like mexican food rice however this is the best I've had&&&&food
The beans are just OK (nobody beat Rito's beans)&&&&food
The service is spotty depending on who it is&&&&ambience+food+service
(Even though u pay after the first bowl)&&&&ambience+cost
The prices are a bit steep for a family style mexican food restaurant&&&&cost+food
I've left there sometimes wondering how the bill was so high&&&&cost
But the food makes up for it and my family goes there at least once a month&&&&food
When the white folk's around me say let's go to Valley Luna I have to school them on what's real food&&&&food
This food is pure Jalisco and it is what it is&&&&food
This is a nice little place w a bar and tv's&&&&ambience+food
My sibling's would live here if they could my sister swears by the green chili burro, not for the weak as it brings the heat&&&&food
I don't eat meat so I get the norm cheese enchiladas, chile relleno, etc all super in my book&&&&ambience+food
I will take pics soon in the meantime here is a recent write up about the place http&&&&service
Closed Monday's---5&&&&service
The service was fine, and the atmosphere, while nothing special&&&&food+service
The food was not that great, it was not as i was expected from the reviews here i read on yelp&&&&food
Food was good,&&&&food
One burrito al a carte and a lunch special plus a beer and a soda&&&&food
Service was great&&&&food+service
What a lot of people don't understand about El Conquistador is that it is on par with the Soup Nazi from Seinfeld&&&&food
You do not go there for ultra-friendly and speedy service, you simply be happy that you are seated at a table about to eat some of the best mexican food in the world&&&&ambience+food+service
Mark and Maria are wonderful people churning out some incredible food&&&&food
It's filled with steak picado, chile relleno and beans and smothered in yummy green sauce&&&&food
booths were open&&&&service
Once we sat down we must have waited around 15 minutes until we received a menu and ask for our drink orders&&&&food+service
Once we ordered it took around 35 minutes for us to receive our appetizer&&&&food+service
Not once during dinner did anyone ask us how our meal was or refill our drinks&&&&food
We had to eat our entire meal without a beverage&&&&food
We must have waited another 20 minutes to receive our bill&&&&cost+food
Our meal was adequate (chicken fajitas, kids quesa and a gringo combo platter)&&&&food
The service was  poor and I would not go here if you are in a hurry&&&&food+service
Maybe the owners should read others reviews about service&&&&food+service
CLOSED at this location now&&&&service
expected to be open Wednesday at new location & 7th and Thunderbird---4&&&&service
The good--Sometimes the service was good&&&&food+service
Warm, slightly teasing, calling us "bambinos"&&&&ambience+food
- I have always liked the food&&&&food
The beans are very tasty too&&&&food
The bad-- When the service was bad it was usually the husband&&&&food+service
Not friendly&&&&service
Wouldn't refill our waters and soft drinks&&&&food
Yet seemed attentive and talkative to other tables&&&&ambience+service
- Slightly overpriced&&&&ambience+cost+food
- Charged for extra chips and salsa&&&&cost
- My husband didn't like the food&&&&food
- Probably my worst experience was when I called at lunchtime to place a to go order&&&&service
She said they couldn't take the order because they had a huge table of people&&&&ambience+service
Just flat out refused&&&&ambience
Guess what I wanted? Just a bean burrito&&&&food
They were on my radar of places to check out due to a reputation for craft beers and good food that I'd heard through a friend -- and, when they popped up as a Groupon, I jumped&&&&ambience+food
I invited a couple other friends who had never been to come along, one of whom is a picky eater (and, after looking at the site, was excited), the other of whom, like me, is always looking to try new beers&&&&food
The food was mediocre to bad&&&&food
I had the bison spaghetti bolognese, which tasted as though they forgot to salt the water when cooking the noodles&&&&food
The sauce was ok,&&&&food
there was precious little of it&&&&cost
When I order a pasta dish at a restaurant and it's $14, I expect it to be something more than I can prep, at home, with little effort&&&&food+service
I wouldn't have been ashamed to serve it myself,&&&&food
I certainly wouldn't have expected any particular compliments after the fact&&&&food
Steak & Frites went to one friend, who's experience was similar to others here&&&&food
steak was dry, tough, bad&&&&food
Other friend had the chicken cordon bleu -- she finished the chicken, which was decent (&&&&food
left the potatoes and vegetables as unpalatable&&&&ambience+food
They didn't have a single one of the craft beers we specifically came to try -- we ended up ordering some Blanche de Chambley (a personal fave,&&&&food+service
They didn't have MacAuslan (either apricot or stout), Black Oak, or Stonehammer (dark or light)&&&&ambience+food
Mill St, Steamwhistle, and the like?  We were bummed&&&&food
Add to this that the server had a rather uncaring attitude, was slow, and, when presenting the bill, just dumped it on the table&&&&ambience+cost
)In any case, I would hesitate giving a 1* rating to Local 4 if only because there's great potential there&&&&ambience+food
nice ambience, cool location, a menu that looks good on paper&&&&ambience+food
they need to seriously re-evaluate what they're doing and their approach to food, drink, and service&&&&food+service
Excellent food (the burger and falafel are two standouts), excellent beer (Black Oak Pale Ale), and friendly service&&&&food+service
The decor is simple&&&&ambience
modern and the servers are all very friendly&&&&service
The main colours of the restaurant are blue and red and the lighting creates a great ambiance, with lit candles lining the rear wall&&&&ambience+food
Upstairs houses 2 of its private dining areas which accommodate groups of 20-50 guests&&&&ambience
I did fell however, that the entrées list was a bit small - especially if you weren't really up for pizza or pasta&&&&food
The house wine was courtesy of House Wine Co&&&&service
featuring both the Red House (a blend of Shiraz and Cabarnet) and the White House (a blend of Riesling and Pinot Grigio)&&&&ambience+food
The starter bread basket was warm, and probably one of the better breads I've had in Toronto&&&&ambience+food
For starters, it was warm&&&&ambience
The bread was perfectly crusty as if it were fresh out of the oven&&&&ambience+food
We opted to share a Spinach Salad ($10) which was tossed with a halved egg, cherry tomatoes, red onion and shaved Parmesan cheese&&&&ambience+food
I found the leaves to have been awkwardly big, and the salad itself was pretty bland&&&&food
The saving grace were the freshly toasted walnuts&&&&ambience+food+service
For mains I opted for the meat special, a Peppercorn Striploin served with a generous portion of sweet potato fries (which I substituted in place of regular fries)&&&&ambience+food+service
I loved that Chef Neil Siomra placed the steak on top of the bed of fries as the jus just trickled down and gave the fries great flavour&&&&food
The steak was cooked to my requested medium-rare,&&&&food
The meat itself had no real flavour and relied heavily on the peppercorn sauce to spruce it up&&&&food
The sweet potato fries were absolutely divine, not too oily, and thin-cut just the way I like them&&&&ambience+food
My dining companion opted for the pasta special which was a Snow Crab Ravioli topped with grilled shrimp&&&&food
The tomato sauce was very fresh&&&&ambience+food
I would've preferred if the ravioli were cooked just a tad more&&&&food
The crab was virtually absent or drowned out by the rich cheese filling as I couldn't discern any of the lumpy meat while eating this dish&&&&food
To finish off the evening we opted to share the Raspberry & Chocolate Tartufo ($7)&&&&food
While it took awhile for the actual dessert to show up, it was well worth the wait&&&&cost
The thin shell had a great texture to it - it reminded me of an Italian mochi with its slightly elastic exterior that was lightly dusted with cocoa powder&&&&ambience+food
The staff at Pallucci make you feel like you're in nana's house&&&&service
They're warm, and serve you with a smile&&&&ambience
They were always around if you needed something, and quick to remove your plates when you've finished&&&&ambience
I must also thank Chef Siomra for bringing us 2 separate plates of salad even though we were sharing&&&&ambience+cost+food
The food here doesn't leave you feeling heavy, and is very fresh&&&&ambience+food
With that said, the food could benefit from a bit of flavour development&&&&food
House wine is cheap and good, appetizers (warm funghi salad) excellent,&&&&ambience+cost+food
my steak frites was way overdone and piled atop what looked like frozen fries&&&&food
My wife's pasta ($17) was, she said, very good&&&&food
Our shared dessert--a lime tart--was excellent&&&&food
If you're lucky enough to get Chris (and most are) service is a 5+&&&&food+service
He knows his stuff, is happy to recommend, and sets a great pace for your meal&&&&food
Ambiance is cozy and comfortable - never too loud&&&&ambience
Food is excellent&&&&food
The sweet potato fries with balsamic glaze are a must&&&&ambience+food
The funghi salad is sooooo good, and my husband swears by the caprese with bocconcini&&&&food
Last time we went I had the tuna spacial and it was delicious&&&&food
Everything is fresh and prepared to your liking&&&&ambience+food
This is a great neighborhood spot&&&&ambience+food
We started with the caprese salad and squid salad&&&&food
the squid portion was a bit small&&&&food
Still tasted fantastic&&&&food
Then she had a beef and mushroom risotto which was pretty damn good&&&&food
Dessert was also fantastic, the creme brûlée inside was custardy and the top crispy as it should be&&&&food
If you want good food they have it&&&&food
Food was pretty good&&&&food
A lil' on the pricey side- $32 for Tuna dish-a price in which the server failed to mentioned- or maybe t'was my fault not to ask, or was I even supposed to be asking for the price? err&&&&cost+food
My friend had some meat dish for about $34&&&&food
Anyways, the service was nice- didnt have to wait 2 hrs for the foods to arrive, so that was good&&&&food+service
Although, my tuna came out somewhat too salty,&&&&food
Their thin-cut fries were amazing- reminded me of the way my grandma used to make fries for us- home fried french fries mmMMmmm Will I go back? um---maybe&&&&food
And i will be sure to order the foods w/ the prices are shown&&&&cost+food+service
I have only ordered delivery from this location&&&&service
The pizza is great tasting, like any other pizza hut I've been to&&&&food
My issues have been regarding my orders&&&&service
More often than not they forget something in my order&&&&service
Once it was a 2L bottle of pop, and quite a few times it's been my dipping sauce&&&&food
I currently have a credit on my pizza hut account for free dipping sauce for the next time I order&&&&food+service
I order here about twice a month and I can understand forgetting once or twice&&&&food+service
The food does arrive hot and on time though, which is a plus&&&&ambience+food
Terrible service&&&&food+service
I called to have a pizza delivered at 9&&&&food
26 and we haven't gotten a call nor did we receive our order from this location&&&&service
Worst service in the world&&&&food+service
This dirty dirty chain 'za (&&&&ambience
the crust is like deep-fried) location now has $7 walk-in specials before 4pm Mon-Wednesday&&&&food
In future, I'll aim to point my deep-fried lust in the direction of L'Alba D'Oro or La Campagnola, both of which are excellent&&&&food
Where do I start, perhaps slapping myself in the face for not having read the only other review on this place BEFORE crossing the threshold of the Clifton Fish Bar&&&&ambience+food
To cut a long story short, I ordered a pizza with salami, peppers, mushrooms and anchovies&&&&food+service
45 mins later I received a pizza with peppers and anchovies&&&&food
On quizzing the (grumpy) guy behind the counter as to the invisible ingredients i had ordered and paid for, he told me they didn't have any mushrooms or salami left&&&&ambience+cost+service
"Then why didn't you tell me this small, insignificant fact at the time i ordered, or subsequent 45 mins whilst I was in your shop?"&&&&service
And how was the pizza you ask? Don't know, ask the rubbish bin not far from his shop&&&&food
The chips were not great,&&&&food

However, Clifton Fish Bar was last year fined for poor hygiene during a standard hygiene test&&&&ambience+food
On hearing this news, I felt a bit sick that I had actually eaten there as the test had found dead mice and mice droppings in the shop&&&&food
However, it must be noted that subsequent to this, the shop has cleaned its act up and although the owner says that he was not aware of any mouse problem, he has put in measures to make sure that such an issue will not arise in the future&&&&ambience
the best thing that it does do is give you confidence that the place is now clean&&&&ambience
The fried rice is amazing, the sweet and sour chicken sauce is thinner than most places&&&&food

By far one of my favorites for pork fried rice and chicken and broccoli they have great egg rolls too---5&&&&food

over the years I have watched the growth and success of plastic surgery while frequenting Barcelona&&&&ambience
I will admit that I have celebrated a few good times here in great company of my best of friends - and this place will always be our FUN hang to 'shake it'&&&&cost+food
Get there before 10pm when the crowds start to form - you will get your warm up walking to the front entrance from where you parked your car&&&&ambience
SORRY that they make you wait in a separate line around the back side&&&&cost
You need a gas mask just to cut through the Axe, bronzer, and fumes of hair gel that linger throughout the air&&&&ambience

If not, just pray in thanks that Scottsdale is where it's at and everything you love is where it is&&&&food
There's a live band that plays and I'm not a fan, mainly because it's not my type of music&&&&ambience
The only reason I'm giving this place 1 star as opposed to none (if that were an option) is that the staff is pretty good&&&&service
They tend to see that everything is going good and do a good job of bringing what you've ordered on time&&&&service
very awkward place, if you are above the age of 40 looking for a place to have a drink&&&&food
I guess I was here twice, maybe a 3rd time,&&&&food
Barcelona was praised to me as the best thing since sliced bread, Blue Martini and Star Trek together (dont have to tell you they all s&&&&ambience+food
The drinks were good and strong,&&&&food
I dont know about the prices&&&&cost+food
I was there with a Detroit crowd (I guess all of Detroit moves to Phx) and for some reason I didnt have to pay for anything&&&&cost
Music was ok, nothing special, just the usual crowd pleasers and some people, mostly MILFS and GILFS (think about it) tried to dance&&&&ambience
Mmm, what about if I am a woman and go there - how would I rate the guyz? - besides one really normal and nice guy who hit on one of my female friends - I would probably puke on the dance floor&&&&cost+food
I wasn't here for the nightly festivities and therefore can't rate the nightclub experience&&&&cost
I did not eat at the restaurant either&&&&food
So I cannot rate that&&&&cost
Barcelona is aesthetically pleasing&&&&ambience
The people who designed and decorated this place did a commendable job&&&&ambience+cost
We sat on the plush patio couches, puffed our cigars and had a few drinks&&&&food
The service was above average&&&&food+service
We had a great time and enjoyed being here&&&&food
The clientele appeared to be a mix of men and women with an average age in the mid-40s&&&&food
They were mostly well dressed and respectable looking&&&&ambience
Barcelona is definitely a high end establishment and if dropping Benjamins is not your thing&&&&ambience
Barcelona has the worst way of letting people know that they're closed until mid-September&&&&ambience+service
Everything was still up like they are still open, website, myspace, all with no indication of their closing&&&&service
Supposedly, we were referred to PCL and someplace else, and were told to tell them that Barcelona sent us and they'd "take care" of us&&&&ambience
Unless I'm getting free bottle service to make up for this blunder, I'm not interested&&&&food+service
Barcelona does&&&&ambience
So, that's where we found ourselves meeting some friends tonight for dinner and drinks&&&&food
We went back and forth on using the heat lamps provided&&&&food
Chelsea was our server and she was sweet as can be&&&&food
The guys seemed to admire looking at her (bustier) every time she leaned over the table, and I was nervous something was going to pop out&&&&ambience
Aside from that entertainment, the food was decent&&&&food
I had the chopped salad which was pretty good and big enough to share, followed by the sea bass (no surprise there) entree&&&&food
We all shared spinach and sweet potato fries as sides, and the guys each had dessert&&&&ambience+food
they seemed to be orgasming over the chocolate lava cake&&&&food
the cheese cake and berry dessert also went over well at the table&&&&ambience+food
For the amount of food we got, this was a deal,&&&&cost+food
had we payed full price? Not so much&&&&cost+food
Oh, blessed Scottsdale&&&&food
Therein lies the problem with Barcelona and her patrons&&&&ambience
I've long heard this place was THE place to see and be seen in Scottsdale&&&&food
But a birthday party for a fine young man fueled my trip on a Saturday night&&&&ambience
--- ahead of many of the plastic millionaires and their shiny chariots&&&&ambience
It's an older crowd at Barcelona than, say, whatever club on Mill Avenue in Tempe&&&&ambience
The uncool cool people prance around while spiced up oldies make communicating with anything other than hand gestures and swirling hips worthless&&&&cost+food
The black-suited security guards talking into their sleeves every few seconds also offer a real --- if not short-lived and ultimately comical --- feel that this place is actually hip&&&&ambience
Make no mistake about it, though, Barcelona is beautifully appointed&&&&ambience
Leather chairs and sofas make for comfy private lounges for the lucky (or wealthy) few who occupy them&&&&ambience+food
The sprawling patio is an excellent place on a late summer evening in Arizona&&&&food
Multiple bars make for relatively speedy service&&&&ambience+food+service
And the overall gargantuan size of the place makes the crowd seem less, well, crowded&&&&ambience
Middle-aged partiers with bulging eyeballs and well- yet artificially endowed gold diggers, on the other hand, are apparently welcomed with open arms&&&&service
I had VIP service so I can't complain about that&&&&food+service
The food was a buffet and was actually quite good&&&&food
Of course I could have eaten a dish rag and been happy as I needed something to soak up the free Patron&&&&food
The crowd was typical for this neck of Scottsdale&&&&food
Could you be any more accurate&&&&cost
We made a quick escape after I was called a fag in the bathroom by some gelled up, steroided out cardboard head dude&&&&ambience
Adios Barcelona&&&&ambience
6 people in their early to mid 20's walks into Barcelona&&&&ambience
Half of them from New York, the other half from San Francisco (or San Fran as the folks in Scottsdale likes to say)&&&&food
With every song played, the folks from separate coasts, just stand there in complete shock&&&&ambience+cost
Given that I just left the real Barcelona (in Spain)- part of me was truly crying inside that night&&&&ambience
OK, I gotta admit- everytime I tell someone I was just in Barcelona (the city) and they say "you mean the one in Scottsdale" there is a part of me that wants to just pack my bags and fly back&&&&ambience+food+service
),  lots of fun and good looking people and the cosmo there is yummy&&&&food
Bills itself as trendy, upscale supper club&&&&cost
The food was good and the service so-so&&&&food+service
My steak from what I remembered was decent&&&&food
A little pricey for the atmosphere&&&&cost+food
Can't take the food too seriously when the music is blaring so loudly&&&&ambience+food
Bad ass bar&&&&ambience
the Decor is awesome&&&&ambience
They had a hip hop group playing live, they really rocked the house, and the DJ in between sets he was was awesome&&&&ambience
we got a table and our own "mixologist"?&&&&ambience
Words will not do it justice, it was an experience&&&&food
I know nothing about the food here&&&&food
for partying it was awesome&&&&ambience
For one, for this fantasy to come true it better happen soon as, I am 36 years old, and the age I prefer to date for long term decreases by the minute&&&&food
Then, again, I never met a girl friend at a bar&&&&ambience
Okay, back to barcelona if you want to indoor lounge they got it, want to hang out outside got it, want to dance on the dance floor got it&&&&ambience
Whatever type of person you are, this is a great place to go if you are the type who can make your own fun&&&&food
Geesh~  Fun decor and nice bartenders&&&&ambience+food
Barcelona is pretty swanky, there's no doubt about that&&&&ambience
The decor is upscale, with a cascading fountain running down a wall of pottery, jars and other items right when you first walk in the doors&&&&ambience
Despite all of this, I like Barcelona&&&&ambience
The dance floor is always packed and they play pretty good music&&&&ambience
The food wasn't good enough for the price and I almost lost an eye when our waiter tried to open our bottle of champagne&&&&cost+food+service
All in all, I think Barcelona can be a fun night spot&&&&ambience
I prefer Old Town Scottsdale night clubs to this one&&&&food
I write reviews that demonstrate I passed high school English&&&&cost
She writes/compliments me&&&&food
If I meet you in person and I lay my lines on you and smile in this certain way that I've discovered makes women look away and blush, you'll definitely give me your number and probably go home with me within one more encounter&&&&ambience
From what I've gathered from movies and television, my life is fairly wonderful&&&&ambience
So my buddy, who's also a man about town and similarly successful in this field, and I decide that this is our new watering hole&&&&food
We've been there twice in the last two weeks&&&&food
Barcelona is where The Business is the understood currency&&&&ambience
But you'd never take my advice because you don't believe me or think you'll succeed next time on your own or think I'm an ass for writing this and you don't want to meet me on principle&&&&food
I feel dirty&&&&ambience
Every bar I have ever walked into has had an alarmingly poor ratio of men to women (too many men and not enough women)&&&&ambience
I have often wondered if every bar has too many men, there must be one place where all of the women go&&&&ambience
It turns out, in Scottsdale, Arizona, that place is Barcelona's&&&&ambience+food
We were seated early in the section that is cleared out to make way for a dance floor as later in the night Zooey Boey takes the stage&&&&ambience+food
We started with a few appetizers, of which my clear favorite was the macadamia nut encrusted shrimp&&&&ambience+food
they were incredibly good (I do not even like macadamia nuts)&&&&food
The portions were more than generous for each person at the table&&&&ambience+service
I had the bone-in-ribeye which came with a Bearnaise sauce on the side that was very good&&&&food
They serve a molten chocolate desert that was heavenly on a soft bed of ice cream&&&&food
The place is a little pricey,&&&&cost+food
Barcelona's is easily my new "go-to" restaurant in Scottsdale&&&&ambience+food
Attire is casual through professional&&&&ambience
Barcelona's is located on the Greenway-Hayden Loop east of Scottsdale Road&&&&ambience+food
Clearly this place does not follow the same motto as the football club&&&&ambience
This is pretty much a standard ho/bro spot&&&&ambience
I recently visited AZ, stayed at the JW Marriott and every single staff person I spoke to said we should party at Barcelona&&&&ambience+service
It started sounding like there was some sort of arrangement between the owners&&&&ambience
Being that I'm vegetarian, we decided that this wasn't the place for dinner&&&&food
The music was great&&&&ambience+food
But the bartenders and waitresses were awesome, the drinks were nummy and i loved the outdoor area with the "cabanas&&&&ambience+food
" Would definitely recommend this place for partying&&&&ambience
from what I've heard- go here to have drinks and dance&&&&food

Too loud for dinner, and not worth the money&&&&cost

In summary, aside from the really bad band (if you can even call them that, they just sig over popular music&&&&ambience
music that I like,&&&&ambience
the singers are so cheesy and weird it freaks me out), I loved Barcelona&&&&ambience
Definitely worth the 15 minute road trip north from Old Town&&&&cost+food
i enjoy Barcelona&&&&ambience
when i moved to Scottsdale, AZ, this was he first bar i went to&&&&ambience+food
It was right down the street from where I lived (which ended up being a great location)&&&&food
all of the greatest friends i made during my year there i met here and im still in touch with today,i normally dont get into that whole "club" scene&&&&food
i don't care for Scottsdale men, they are WANNABE's, drive their BMW's yet live with like 6 other roommates just so they can AFFORD that BMW&&&&ambience+food
If there was a section on Yelp about Scottsdale men, i don't think there would be enough room for my negative opinion&&&&food
But like i said, the service is great, i loved my bartender James&&&&ambience+food+service

If you are a young man and want to get down with an older, nice looking woman- go here&&&&food
Muchas gracias to Geetah and Hank for taking little 'ol out-of-towner me to Barcelona&&&&ambience

If you want a good meal, AVOID Barcelona&&&&ambience
This was Barcelona in Chandler, so I can imagine what the Hayden location would be like&&&&ambience
Barcelona was a great restaurant years ago and had the best paella in Scottsdale&&&&ambience+food
Today, Barcelona is supposed to be a club scene,&&&&ambience
in actuality, it's fairly empty&&&&ambience

Yes, the live band's slightly cheesy,&&&&ambience
when you're inebriated, who cares? Caution, for cougar lovers, there are a lot prowling around, waiting to sink their claws in young meat&&&&food
I've never had the opportunity to eat there, so I can't say anything in regards to food&&&&food+service
I've met my share of extremely weird characters, like this man who was trying to pull girls from the dance floor or the bar, to share the VIP experience with his son who was celebrating his birthday&&&&ambience

Anyways, after the $10 cover charge, they gave me a ticket for a free fish taco or something&&&&cost+food
I don't want to eat fish tacos at 11pm&&&&food
This place reminded me of Cheesecake Factory after dark&&&&ambience+food
They don't have a DJ, instead they have a band that does bad covers of bad songs like "Wind it Up" and "Glamorous"&&&&ambience+food
Worst part? I saw old guys wearing phat farm tennis shoes and mandals&&&&food

If you're meeting someone for drinks it's okay&&&&food
Almost always crowded with pretentious people, the dance floor is tiny, the food is average and everything is expensive&&&&ambience+food
The drinks are through the roof expensive&&&&ambience+food
Barcelona is the simultaneously the most awesome and the very worst club I've ever been to&&&&ambience

It came out medium, and the glaze and whatever else they put on it were awful, save the two onion rings&&&&food
I doubt this was USDA prime beef&&&&food
It just wasn't that good, and the room was so dark that it was hard to see what I was eating&&&&ambience+food
The shoestring fries side were a pleasant surprise - a giant mound of crispy potato&&&&ambience+food

I met an Eastern European fighter, slow danced to Sinatra with the owner of a foreign auto dealership, and encountered a funny old man who must've been about 90 that somehow got on stage to shake his groove thang with the female singer&&&&ambience

I do agree that it's strange to buy drinks in the ladies room and that some chicks seem to lounge on the couch in there, checkin out other chicks when they walked through the door&&&&ambience+food
All in all, the only reason I can't give this place 4 stars is b/c of the outrageous drink prices&&&&cost+food

Would give a fifth star for a more competitive price (little high on weekends at $13+ per adult), a slighttlyyy bigger selection, and dinner buffet availability&&&&ambience+cost+food
The food is pretty good here, especially the various biryanis they make&&&&food
My kids like the Tandoori chicken&&&&food
They have melons/fruits for dessert, too, so the kids like that, as well&&&&food
And the naan--well, the naan--what can you say about naan? mmmmmm&&&&food
Naan is a type of Indian bread, in case you've not had it&&&&food
Waaay too much carbs when you eat here&&&&food
The downfall to this place--the service isn't the best here&&&&food+service
If you order water, they don't keep your glass full, and sometimes it tastes bad and you have to ask for a fresh glass of water&&&&ambience+food+service
AND, they never know how much the kids are supposed to cost for the buffet&&&&cost
There's no sign for prices,and when you ask, you get a different answer each time&&&&cost+food
A few times they didn't charge us for the 1-yr olds' buffet, and the last time we went, we were charged for both kids&&&&cost
I said, I thought he was free (indicating my 1yr old) and the kid serving us got the manager, who was an American female (no Indians to be found manning the floor) and she said there was a charge for each person's meal&&&&cost+service
Since they are so confused and can't be bothered to give menus or post the prices and ages, we probably won't go back often&&&&cost+food
anyways, I had wanted to try Matka, was starting to see the reviews and thought oh it's time to check this place out&&&&ambience
When I suggested it he said yea sounds good&&&&ambience
We walked inside and saw we were one of the 1st people there, the owner, who was present was very friendly and helpful with everything&&&&service
No problem we stayed at our table and sat and talked,&&&&ambience
Spicy, smoky and just delish, had a potato dish too, think its called aloo methi? Man that too was packed with little bit of heat,&&&&ambience+food
not in a bad way, those 2 dishes might even get me to be a vegetarian for maybe a hour or so, um maybe not because I&&&&food
spotted the&&&&ambience
ter chicken in that creamy orange sauce and the chili chicken with big slices of jalapenos and though who can live on veggie alone&&&&food
ter chicken and chili chicken are white meat and so very delish, also had some of the vegetable biryani and nana bread too&&&&ambience+food
Also side note, my date tried the goat biryani and thought it to be spicy and told the owner, who tried it and said yea it's on the spicy side, will make up a new batch right now, now to me that's excellent service&&&&food+service
I hope to see Matka stays around because I sure do plan on coming back&&&&ambience
Tried this place on 4th of July, decent amount of folks eating there that day&&&&cost+food
Had the Palak Chicken which was good flavor, green sauce with spinach&&&&food
We also ordered Poori bread, which had big bubbles that were fun to poke at&&&&food+service
Since it was fried, the kids loved the crunchy top&&&&food
Hubby had the Lamb Vindaloo which was spicy and really good flavor, red sauce with lots of good spice&&&&food
The food is a little spicy,&&&&food
we like spicy&&&&food
One downer is that I had to keep asking for a water refill, instead of them automatically checking in on us&&&&ambience+food
Also had the sugarcane drink&&&&food
it tasted bland, like it was poured out of a can or a gallon, not at all fresh&&&&ambience+food
Recently, I was disappointed to find out this restaurant received a D from the county's health service, big turn off for any future return&&&&food+service
We hadn't planned on it anyway because the bill was too high for 2 entrees, one extra side of bread and a drink&&&&cost+food
The floor of the restaurant had stuff strewn all over- a turn off when you're there to eat, and fail to see how they couldn't have the waitstaff sweep the place in less than 10 mins&&&&food+service
There was only 1 other family dining, so clearly they weren't swamped&&&&ambience
The paneer was just not right, too much tomato sauce and store bought paneer doesn't amount to great tasting&&&&ambience+cost+food
ter paneer&&&&food
The chicken dishes were average to below average&&&&food
The dessert was horrible - runny mango custard, tasteless fried sweet bread&&&&food
There was zero ambience&&&&ambience
They have excellent tasting food, great ambience (because they actually employed an interior designer to do up their restaurant) and great prices&&&&ambience+cost+food
Their flavors are unmatched&&&&ambience+food
99 buffet needs to be worth that much, and I'm sorry,&&&&cost
Matka isn't worth it,&&&&ambience+cost
It was hotter inside than outside&&&&ambience+food
Papad was cold and old&&&&ambience+food
The food was expensive and BAD&&&&food
Recently my wife and I noticed this place while going for dim sum at C-Fu Gourmet, which is in the same strip mall&&&&ambience+food
We noticed their lunch buffet was substantially larger than other Indian places, so we vowed to give it a try&&&&food
99 all you can eat&&&&food
The food was up in my top three favorites in Phoenix and the service was excellent&&&&food+service
I talked a little with the owner and he told me that everything is made fresh everyday&&&&ambience+food
You really can't go wrong here--the cheapest, the best selection, and one of the best flavor-wise in the Valley&&&&cost+food
I had the lunch buffet a week after it opened, and it was really good&&&&service
The food was fresh and the chicken and goat dishes were very good&&&&ambience+food
But for me, the veggie daals, byranni, lentil soup and the Indian eggplant (don't remember the Indian name) was outstanding&&&&food
The owner told me he changes the buffet each day so the food is fresh&&&&ambience+food
99 for a very large buffet on a Saturday nite, it was more than worth a visit&&&&cost
I'm going back for that mango daal, the tamarind rice, and the egg plant (whatever it's called)&&&&food
What most people don't realize about Indian food is that it changes from region to region&&&&food
Most Indian restaurants in this country serve only Punjabi (northern food)&&&&food
Matka specializes in Hyderabadi food&&&&ambience+food
The city of Hyderabad is known all over India for having the most flavorful food with influences from both south and north&&&&food
tic Hyderabadi food outside of Hyderabad until now&&&&food
It's spicy and full of flavor&&&&food
And the biryani at Matka is to die for&&&&ambience
They also have a a huge variety in their buffet with many delectable options to choose from&&&&ambience
Food is fresh&&&&ambience+food
You can taste the difference&&&&food
I have to eat here at least once a week out i start having withdrawals&&&&food
I found Matka without any previous information (they have been here for a couple of months) and decided to try them because they are in such a convenient location (for me)&&&&ambience
I had a great buffet lunch&&&&food
Very nice naan, very nice papadums, very nice pakoras, stuff that will tell you how good a place is&&&&food
You can change your name from Matka to Kamat to anything else&&&&ambience
if you have to advertise that you are not "recycling" (which is re-serving one customers food to another that may have been untouched), and that all food is cooked daily, you have to seriouslywonder&&&&food
ter chicken was ok&&&&food
The tandoori chicken was dry and old and they dont follow the online buffet menu&&&&food
I rate this as&&&&cost
"been there done that"Naan was burnt&&&&food
masala dosa was a nice touch&&&&food
Thats like a wing place running out of wing sauce&&&&food
We had been there to the lunch buffet on a friday couple of weeks ago and the food was awful&&&&food
The restaurant itself is very boring with no music or ambience and uninviting&&&&ambience
I was hoping that we get some good food there&&&&food
The papadum tasted horrible probably because of the oil&&&&food
The tandoori chicken tray was empty&&&&food
They did not care to refill the empty food trays&&&&food
The owner was bit rude when we complained to him of the quality&&&&service
I don't mind paying 13 dollars for the food,&&&&cost+food
not for the food they offer&&&&food
Chutneys on baseline is a lot better bargain in comparison to this restaurant though the pricing is similar for the buffet&&&&ambience
The only +ve experience was the bottled water they offered at no extra cost and the chicken biriyani&&&&cost+food
I went to Matka for dinner and found that they have a buffet&&&&ambience
Food was below average to average&&&&food
I'm not at all a vegetarian,&&&&food
I usually look forward to Indian buffets for the vegetarian choices&&&&food
They do have the usual Aloo Gobi (cauliflower dish), Palak Paneer, and the pakoras&&&&food
As for the meat dishes, the&&&&food
ter chicken rather bland - shocking for&&&&food
ter chicken, I know&&&&food
They also had a lamb curry (ok,&&&&food
not as flavorful as most Indian lamb dishes should be), Chili chicken (actually pretty good&&&&food
), Chicken vindaloo (average ) and a few other things that I can't remember since they were relatively nondescript&&&&food
The price was acceptable&&&&ambience+cost+food
The decor was typical&&&&ambience
The service was pleasant enough&&&&food+service
I think they just opened - in a way, this means that you can give them the benefit of the doubt&&&&service
For a place that claims they don't reheat food, it's ironic because the buffet had the quintessential "reheated Indian buffet food" taste&&&&food
Make no mistake, this is a South Indian restaurant through and through&&&&ambience
it tastes like South Indians cooking North Indian food&&&&food
Sambar is in nearly everything and it tastes sour which can tell you where the chef is from&&&&ambience+food
The place was hot and muggy inside&&&&ambience+food
The place had an odor and it just felt really dirty in there&&&&ambience
Matka is now Kamat&&&&ambience
and the taste has been getting better and better with each of my visit&&&&food
It opened as KAMAT recently and I was there shortly when it reopened&&&&ambience+service
I was given a warm welcome by the Owner Lady, and we ordered some snacks&&&&ambience+service
Everything was delicious&&&&food
At this rate I am sure this restaurant will very soon be the No&&&&cost
Everything is wonderful including the people and service&&&&food+service
Fresh, tasty and very au&&&&ambience+food
We were shopping around the area when we noticed this restaurant and decided to go in for buffet lunch&&&&food
The food was typical south Indian with not a lot of good options for Vegetarians&&&&food
Me and wife tried out a few dishes - Paneer dish was sweet, the Bagaire Baigan (eggplant) was way too oily&&&&ambience+food
Veggie food only saving grace was sambhar&&&&food+service
I eat meat, so I tried out the chicken biryani which was average, other dishes were average too&&&&food
My wife's pregnant so she takes a bit long to finish her food, the restaurant server apparently didn't like that, she was trying to hurry us even though they were open for another half hour and had only 25% tables occupied&&&&ambience+food+service
We eat out quite frequently&&&&food
The chef needs to know that Indian food needs salt&&&&food
Food tastes like Indian hospital food if theresn't any salt&&&&food
Interestingly , there was no music either&&&&ambience
Sambar is supposed to be a mix of Tamarind water, spices, Dal and vegetables like onion&&&&ambience+food
When we entered , the Naan tray was empty&&&&food
When I tried twice later on, they were empty&&&&food
The owner or manager was right there&&&&service
But there wasnt sufficient Naan at all&&&&food
I left without even having an opportunity to taste Naan&&&&food
Andhra Chicken was ok and so was the egg curry&&&&food
Butter chicken tasted very dry and with no spice&&&&food
What is up with the vegetarian choices - egg plant curry and zucchini curry&&&&food
Can u not come up with better choices for Sunday buffet?e&&&&food
The served bottle water which was good&&&&food
food should be good too which was absent&&&&food
I thought the menu said vegetable biryani&&&&ambience
I only saw colored rice&&&&food
Didnt taste like Biryani&&&&food
Food felt fresh as the website claimed&&&&ambience+food
The owner needs to add some interiors to this restaurant otherwise it would compete only with the C-Fu next door instead of being a restaurant for dinner&&&&food
I would revisit to give them a fair chance at dinner this month&&&&ambience
There are better Indian choices at the moment in the valley&&&&food
Definitely good Indian food&&&&food
We had the Spring Vegetable Dosa for appetizer that was super yummy&&&&ambience+food
For main course we split the Vegetable Biryani,  Chicken palak,  okra and tomatoes, and goat masala&&&&ambience+food
Everything was EXCELLENT and super TASTY&&&&food
If you want good Indian food in Chandler come here&&&&food
In short, tasty food with a great flavor&&&&food
The chicken biriyani is by far the best i have had in phoenix&&&&food
I have been there for dinner (ordered a la carte') and the lunch buffet which had impressive spread&&&&service
Also, they provide bottled water at no additional cost&&&&cost+food
This has changed ownership and name and is now Kamat (an anagram of Matka, oddly) and is just getting started&&&&ambience
I've been to Kamat twice now and the food is just lovely&&&&ambience+food
org/wiki/Thali    I had a chicken biryani thali that came with rice, daal, naan, kheer and more&&&&food
I can't wait to go again and try the goat curry&&&&food
It's a small operation so be patient with the staff or try the lunch buffet&&&&service
I could have given 5 stars for the food&&&&food
I was told by one of my colleague that the food taste and options are great&&&&food
But the quality and taste did not come close to what we were expecting&&&&food
Seems like the food was recycled from the lunch buffet&&&&food
The naans were hard like stone also the mutton biriyani tasted like eating uncooked rice&&&&food
Purchased tuna sub which tasted par for the course being from Subway&&&&food
However, one of the two cookies with my combo had a hair baked into it&&&&ambience+food
Unfortunately I did not notice until I had eaten half the cookie&&&&food
It is always clean and the staff has been consistent for quite a long time&&&&ambience+service
It's always clean and the owner seems to be on the ball&&&&ambience
And they always have those chocolate chip cookies ready (not the case for every Subway&&&&food
)The only reason for the four stars opposed to five is the constant turnover for employees, which can make ordering slow at times because someone new is often being trained&&&&service
Overall, if you're looking for a clean and reliable Subway, this location should be considered&&&&ambience
I know that this airport strives to be the friendliest&&&&ambience
We waited for 10 min at a table while all the servers wiped tables, chatted, etc&&&&ambience
Finally we got menus thrown on the table, no hi, no nothing, while she was on her way to the next table&&&&ambience
That table had been trying to flag her down to tell her there was something wrong with their food&&&&ambience+food
I guess at least I got a place to sit for 20 minutes undisturbed&&&&food
Oh wait, this is an airport, I can sit anywhere&&&&ambience
Damn, can I get my 20 minutes back?---1&&&&food
It's an airport bar that serves the kind of food you expect from a quick little bar near the gate&&&&ambience+food
Not healthy, not hand prepared lovingly by a team of 5 star cooks&&&&food
Quick bite to eat with a beer or cocktail before you pushback&&&&food
I guess the nice thing to say would be that they had beer and I didn't get food poisoning?The staff pretty much could care less if you're there or not - I don't think I've experienced a server that was that checked-out in a long time&&&&food+service
My food was edible,&&&&food
came on a plastic plate? For real?? Is there not a real kitchen back there? No dishwasher&&&&ambience
If I didn't have a meal voucher from United and had to pay for what I consumed this would be a one-star&&&&cost
I'd rather eat Wendy's&&&&food
Decent food, decent beer, fast service, what more do you want?  Price was fair too&&&&ambience+cost+food+service
The pluses - they serve beer and have sport on screens at the bar&&&&ambience
The minuses - food is nasty (think very bad school cafeteria)&&&&food
wait staff we had were pretty rude&&&&service
it doesn't come cheap which is actually a blessing as you are less likely to order&&&&cost+service
Reincarnated from "Wok on Yonge", this restaurant has very basic decor, and a huge menu of both Thai and Chinese dishes&&&&ambience
My favourite dish is the cold spring rolls appetizer, and I often get the mango salad and Tom Yum (thai lemongrass) soup&&&&ambience+food
I've found the Thai curries vary from tasty to meh, and the Pad Thai is just okay, in my opinion&&&&food
On the Chinese side, I really liked  the Crispy Ginger Beef - it reminded me of Calgary Ginger Beef, which I sometimes miss&&&&food
Definitely not the healthiest choice, though&&&&food
Service also varies, though it's usually pretty good&&&&food+service
Prices seem average given the amount and quality of the food&&&&cost+food
Some dishes like their cold spring rolls are pretty awesome and the tom yum soup is good&&&&ambience+food
Their main dishes like Pad Thai and other noodles and rice dishes are just okay&&&&food
too much sauce or weird sauce flavour&&&&food
I ordered stir fry veggies and it was practically raw, the sauce they used was kinda gross, so I didn't even eat the dish&&&&food+service
unless I get an order of take out of their cold spring rolls&&&&ambience+food+service
They are pretty awesome , like I have mentioned&&&&ambience
) The service is fast and good&&&&food+service
5 Star If I going to rate Phuket Paradise based on their Chicken Pad Thai, It would deserved a 1 star&&&&cost+food
99 with soup or spring roll&&&&food
The selections are quite good with both Chinese and Thai fares&&&&cost
?? Both the Coconut Soup and Tom Yum Soup were really tasty, especially the Coconut soup which tasted good without being creamy&&&&food
The Tom Yum is on the sour side,&&&&food
my Yoga classmate seemed to enjoy that&&&&ambience
Green Curry Chicken which suppose to be 3 chili spicy lack the spiciness,&&&&food
I was surprised with all the veggie and the use of white meat in the dish&&&&food
the only thing is good about it is at least Phuket Paradise didn't use ketchup&&&&food
But the Tamarind sauce they used tasted blend and the dish is kind of lukewarm not hot from the wok&&&&ambience+food
Deco is nice&&&&food
the whole restaurant smelled like bleach&&&&ambience
But maybe I should feel assured that they scrubbed the floor really clean??&&&&ambience
It is clean, welcoming and bright&&&&ambience+service
they also feature a large number of Chinese dishes&&&&food
I had a Thai Coconut infused seafood soup&&&&food
It came quickly, was nice and hot and had a nice balance of flavour&&&&ambience+food
This is at the core of Thai food, that blend of tastes with the lemon grass assertively tweaking the mix&&&&food
As an appetizer, we indulged in the cold rice paper rolls&&&&ambience+food
The dip was very tasty, hut the rolls fell flat&&&&ambience+food
They had an unexciting melange of vegetsbles with cellophane noodles, and not the usual shrimps&&&&food
I regretted not listening to my wifenas she urged me not to order 2 serving of the appetizer&&&&service
As mains we ordered a Green Curry with heef and a Seafood and chicken Pad Thai, with a bowl of steamed rice&&&&ambience+food+service
tic and good, with a good amount of tamarind to arrive at the right taste and colour&&&&cost+food
The Green Curry was delicious, with an ample serving of delicious and tender slices of beef&&&&food
We drank Jasmine tea with our meal&&&&food
Overall the food was good, the portions large and the vibe OK&&&&food
At $52 before HST it was a bit pricey&&&&cost+food
This maybe due to the fact that we were charged for 2 teas&&&&cost+food
Hard to find - food is just okay,&&&&food
Considering that you can share one plate among two people, it's great value for the money&&&&ambience+food
it's tranquil place to grab a bite most weeknights&&&&food
A long time ago - used to be home to Chopsticks, at the time, Thornhill's only legitimate Chinese restaurant&&&&ambience+food
Amazing value for afternoon lunch that can't be beat&&&&food
Huge portions that include either a spring roll or a soup&&&&food
Surprising the coconut chicken soup was really great and definitely made for a good appetizer&&&&food
The damn creamy curry&&&&food
Usually if you get it with a meat it also comes with string beans&&&&food
I ask them to sub out the meat out for eggplant and it is just perfecttttt&&&&food
The curry is mild and is legit one of my favs in toronto&&&&food
you won't care once you try the curry&&&&food
But being the only choice for Thai food in the area, you don't really have a choice&&&&food
We ordered a Thai combo for 4 for take out&&&&service
They said the food will be ready in 10 minutes and they weren't kidding&&&&food
I arrived about 10 minutes after I placed the call and the food was ready and packaged and sitting on the counter&&&&ambience+food
We took the food home to eat and it pretty much confirmed my suspicions on au&&&&food
Best dish of the night and tastes au&&&&food
The dish is loaded with flavor and chicken pieces&&&&food
Phad thai chicken&&&&food
PP's phad thai feels like Chinese stir-fry to me&&&&food
Too light on the fish sauce, not enough eggs, and I think they used onions instead of shallots&&&&ambience+food
Basil Beef&&&&food
It kind of tastes like regular Chinese stir-fry beef with veggies with an added spiciness&&&&food
Compared with the red curry, the there's a lot less meat in this dish&&&&food
Tamarind Shrimp&&&&food
I never want to eat this dish again&&&&food
This is not tamarind&&&&food
This tastes like Chinese sweet and sour sauce, and not a very well made one&&&&food
Their prices aren't cheap,&&&&cost+food
The portion size is generous&&&&service
I'm most disappointed by the Phad Thai and the Tamarind shrimp&&&&food
But I wouldn't mind ordering a curry again&&&&food+service
coconut soup, green curry shrimp, ice tea latte thing they make, and mango salad&&&&food
The food is decent enough, service is not so bad considering it never gets that full (that fact should tell me something) The only reason I come here is because they have a chicken version of szechuan szechuan's crispy ginger beef which I really like&&&&food+service
I've had several other dishes such as pad thai, mango salad, green curry beef and each one has been pretty average&&&&food
Not great&&&&food
We ordered a steak, a prosciutto with melon platter, caprese salad, and a calamari&&&&food+service
The calamari tasted phenomenal, as did the prosciutto&&&&food
The steak was covered in gravy sauce,&&&&food
the steak itself was not as good in flavor nor texture&&&&food
"Dinner for two", which also included a soda, bottle of water, a tiramisu and cappuccino costed 72€, plus my voluntary tip&&&&cost+food
(I always tip generously at restaurants, except when the waitstaff treats us cheaply&&&&cost+food+service
)We overall enjoyed our experience at the table as a group until the end when the waiter tried to charge one of the couples in our group for additional items which they did not order&&&&ambience+cost+service
It seems as if somebody else's meal had not been paid and our friends were being pressured to pay it&&&&cost
The waiter had the audacity to tell one of the ladies in our group that paying it would not make you poor&&&&cost+service
5 star experience, with the 1 star treatment in the end, they get a very generous 3-star&&&&food+service
My waiter was great&&&&food+service
The food was outstanding and they have Bitburger on tap&&&&food
From the salad to the entree, this place has it together&&&&food
On both nights I went the waiter, one was hot, gave me great service and no issues with my bill&&&&ambience+cost+food+service
They use the correct amount of arugula in their dishes, which is hard to do&&&&cost
Die Karte "schockiert" vielleicht durch die etwas erhöhten Preise, aber diese sollte man gerne in Kauf nehmen, denn die Pizzas sind kaum zu übertreffen&&&&food
Für mich gab es eine Dorade, es war außen kross gebraten und innen zart saftig, als Beilage gab es Bratkartoffeln in Weißweinsauce&&&&cost+food
Im großen und ganzen ist das Essen und die Gastfreundschaft sehr zu empfehlen, die Einrichtung und das Ambiente sind nicht modern aber gemütlich&&&&ambience
Amazing fresh cooked meal, homemade pasta, and a friendly environment where you are treated like an old friend&&&&ambience+food+service
I spilled my sambuca and he instantly brought another&&&&ambience
Der Gastraum ist wenig einladend, dafür war der Service umso besser&&&&food+service
Die Speisen (Tomatensuppe, Antipasti, Pasta) waren sehr schön angerichtet und lecker&&&&ambience+food
Die Pasta von der Tageskarte war sehr lecker&&&&food
Employes were just standing around talking to each other in there native language, didn't care about the costumers&&&&cost
No hair net&&&&ambience
Talking to fellow employees and spitting all over food&&&&food+service
This place is a godsend for guests at nearby hotels who would otherwise go hungry or live on room-temperature snacks for the duration of their stay&&&&ambience+food
I had a veggie sandwich, which was delicious and life-affirming, considering the circumstances&&&&food
Why? First of all, it's in close proximity to the Toronto Airport hotels&&&&ambience+food
This is huge for late night eaters who don't want to wander all over Toronto to get a meal&&&&food
The service was prompt, friendly and accurate&&&&cost+food+service
What more can you ask for in fast food? I was very satisfied&&&&food
The Indian gentleman that crafted my sandwich added a certain ingredient that made the sandwich wonderful and unforgettable--yes my friends--LOVE&&&&ambience
First visit was adequate service and average sub&&&&food+service
This morning was surly service and a not great sub as a bonus she put the wrong sauce on to go with stingy toppings&&&&food+service
There's lots of choices in the area including another Subway&&&&food
I went with three kids and found that the groupon is not worth buying UNLESS its just two people going&&&&cost
For example, the groupon is not valid for their "kids eat for 99 cents with each paying adult"&&&&cost+food
Not to mention the food is over priced for the quality as well&&&&cost+food
Also, the have All-you-can-eat fish Fridays for roughly $10&&&&ambience+food
The waitresses there are VERY rude&&&&service
I told her I was waiting for the groupon to load and it would only be a second be cause we were not expecting to come and her response was "so do you want a seat or what?" the place was not that busy for her to be so rude&&&&food+service
anyhow, I never complained and eventually after being sitted the waiters kept walking by like we didn't exist until the supervisor (I believed him to be) came over and took our order and he was nice&&&&food+service
The environment and the way they treat their customers is rude over all and I've been there 3 times over the last 2 years&&&&ambience+food+service
The fried pickles were barely battered this time so my kids didn't enjoy them as much&&&&ambience+food
Oh and don't ask the wrong person for help because they will tell you that they are not in charge of your table and will walk away&&&&ambience+cost
Val and Bill are the bomb&&&&cost
Great friendly service and fresh delicious food&&&&ambience+food+service
Fries that came with children's menu mac 'n cheese were overdone, too brown & crunchy&&&&food
Mac 'n cheese was too hot for the baby to eat at first,&&&&ambience+food
My scrambled eggs were overdone and lukewarm&&&&ambience+food
This place does not know how to do scrambled eggs&&&&food
Waitress asked if I wanted my bacon crispy and I said yes - it came out almost burnt and cold&&&&ambience+food
ter substitute that it was soggy and cold by the time I got to it&&&&ambience+food
Husband's order was wrong - eggs over easy turned into scrambled eggs, and his eggs were overdone too&&&&food+service
He enjoyed his sausage and pancakes though, and I thoroughly enjoyed my hashbrowns&&&&ambience+food
They were delicious&&&&food
My coffee was good,&&&&food
I had to bring my own flavored creamer - all they have is plain cream and sugar&&&&food
Our waitress asked when we first were seated if we'd been there before, and we said yes&&&&food
She breezed by 15 minutes later and asked the same question again&&&&food
She seemed very rushed, distracted, and not terribly friendly&&&&ambience+service
we ended up feeling rushed too&&&&ambience
Our waitress brought two loyalty cards with our bill, both with one stamp on them - she didn't ask if we already had a loyalty  card&&&&ambience+cost+service
Did she miss the part where we said yes, we'd been there before? When I presented my loyalty card to her and asked her to put the two new stamps on my card, she said (with attitude), "We don't combine cards&&&&service
" I had to explain that she didn't even ask if I had one, and that I simply wanted her to stamp my card instead of giving us two new ones&&&&food
She gave me one stamp on top of a spot that was already stamped, and when I pointed it out, she just gave me a new card with one additional stamp&&&&ambience
Today's experience is pretty typical in terms of food quality&&&&food
Unless I have a really great deal, like a Groupon or a two-for-one, I'll never visit 5 and Diner again&&&&food
It simply doesn't impress me with its service or its food&&&&food+service
The burgers were so dry and flavorless, I'm amazed people still would even go here, you might as well go to Carl's Jr, Wendy's, or Jack in the Box instead of this place&&&&food
Boy, she works hard and cares about her customers and her staff&&&&service
Much of her staff has been at this location forever, and Val has owned this restaurant for 13 years&&&&service
Sometimes she has an awesome magician there&&&&ambience
and I usually hate when those magicians come by our table when I'm trying to enjoy my dinner&&&&ambience
I love the music - though sometimes it's too loud&&&&ambience
I'm sure Val would turn down the music if you asked her to do so&&&&ambience
The food - sometimes very good and sometimes ho-hum, depending on what you order&&&&food+service
What can I say?  I'm very picky about my food and my staff and my atmosphere&&&&food+service
The fries are great when you order them extra-crispy (which is how I always order my fries if I happen to get them)&&&&food+service
The club sandwich is great and HUGE - an excellent value&&&&food
My husband ALWAYS orders the club sandwich, which he loves&&&&service
I order a variety of items whenever we go there, and I've found the breakfast items for dinner usually suit me the best&&&&service
My daughter loves their macaroni and cheese and all their other kid items&&&&food
Service was INCREDIBLY slow&&&&food+service
Food was ok,&&&&food
No apologies for lack of service&&&&food+service
No return once food was served&&&&food
Won't be eating here again&&&&food
They automatically added 18% tip for party of 6, definitely not earned&&&&ambience
The decor is great&&&&ambience+food
There are little jukeboxes at every table&&&&ambience
The service is good&&&&food+service
But the menu is a little too Denny's-like for my taste&&&&food
There is a good selection of burgers and breakfast items,&&&&food
A bit pricey too&&&&cost+food
Smells like a public restroom in the diner&&&&ambience
Avoid at all costs&&&&cost
When I visit Phoenix, this is the best place for burgers and fries&&&&food
They do some unique soda flavors&&&&food
This place was awesome - Val our waitress was super nice and very helpful&&&&ambience+food+service
Place is a cool looking diner with a MASSIVE menu, was all most too hard to decide what to eat&&&&food
I had a reuben and the kids both had pancakes (mickey mouse shaped - so cute) - the best though was my husband's a double burger - I can't remember when we had anything so good, yes - I had to eat some of it&&&&food
Not only is the decor cute and retro, we had fantastic service and our breakfasts were wonderful&&&&ambience+food+service
It was really a nice surprise&&&&food
Great food and wonderful service&&&&food+service
Whenever I am there, I always feel welcomed by the staff and I have never had a problem with service&&&&food+service
The food good and the atmosphere is fun&&&&food
Incredibly polite and efficient service&&&&food+service
We came for breakfast and were bowled away by how great the service was - the waiter had every possible configuration of questions on how we'd like out food, and even offered salsa as soon as the entrees came out&&&&ambience+food+service
I wasn't planning on salsa for my Chicken Fried Steak and Eggs&&&&food
Well, the salsa was delicious with the perfect amount of kick - I ended up dousing my&&&&cost+food
Eggs and chicken fried steak were both tasty and the toast was thick cut and good to sop up the extra gravy&&&&food
Truly a yummy 3-star meal, though the great service just bumped things up even more&&&&food+service
They were just SO nice and so insistent that we come back, I'm wondering if the location (in the Arizona Mills parking lot) is making the business struggle a bit&&&&food
Salads are very iceberg-heavy&&&&food
My daughter commented that the lettuce tasted almost frozen&&&&food
Chicken Pot Pie ( "NEW" ) is not much more in quantity than the $3&&&&ambience+food
French fries were hot and crunchy and good&&&&ambience+food
The AWFUL chicken strips&&&&food
You know those mass-market wholesale version strips that are 90% thick, heavy breading and leave you about a 10% chicken portion?  Yep, they use those&&&&cost+food
There is a layer of impossibly hard and tasteless breading on the outside,&&&&food
a little thin moist layer of unfried breading under that, and&&&&food
in the small remaining center a smidgen of real chicken&&&&food
NEGATIVE 500 STARS on the gross chicken strips&&&&food
Not worth it at all&&&&cost
I have eaten here several times (mostly because of coupons) and they all fell below 3 stars&&&&food
My wife and I needed a place to grab some lunchtime breakfast food over the weekend, and seeing as how we couldn't find anything better, we stopped by 5 and Diner&&&&food
My wife ordered the pancake sandwich with two eggs and I ordered a side of biscuits and gravy with raisin toast&&&&food+service
Overall, the service wasn't too slow considering how busy it was and I didn't have any trouble getting refills&&&&food+service
When my wife ordered the pancake sandwich the server asked my wife "do you like bacon or sausage", to which she replied "bacon"&&&&food+service
Normal question when ordering breakfast right? Well, when the bill came, little did we know that the pancake sandwich didn't actually come with bacon and the server put a dollar charge on the tab for adding bacon&&&&cost+food+service
When I confronted her about the dollar charge she said "the pancake sandwich doesn't come with bacon, that's extra"&&&&cost+food
Well, we weren't informed that answering a question as to preference would result in an extra charge&&&&cost
We weren't informed that she was in fact adding things to our tab to inflate the price without telling us&&&&ambience+cost+food
I put up enough of a fuss that she removed the charge, and  I could tell that she knew she had added the charge in a duplicitous manner and she was just hoping we wouldn't catch on&&&&cost
The food was decent,&&&&food
what happened?Several of us stopped by this 5 & Diner location (Arizona Mills) around 7 PM today (11-10-2012) and they are CLOSED&&&&service
There was a handwritten sign on the front door stating in essence 'we're closed and thanks for the memories'&&&&service
(I'd give this store 4 stars since I've eaten here in the past&&&&food
Why?Okay, it's the sweet and sassy waitress&&&&food
The food is mediocre&&&&food
On this last visit, we ordered dinner&&&&service
The pot pie was okay and included a big dinner salad for about $8&&&&ambience+food
Part of the inflated check was that the aforementioned waitress upsold the dessert to us at $3&&&&ambience
99 per slice of cake or pie&&&&food
Carrot cake?  Nearly inedible&&&&food
With two people splitting a piece, 1/3 of it got eaten&&&&food
It tasted like it had been in a freezer&&&&food
DH, who loves carrot cake and could eat a whole sheet by himself could barely swallow a bite&&&&ambience+food
The 9 year old girl who ordered it said&&&&service
"this does not even taste like carrots&&&&food
"  I thought it tasted like a dry spice cake that had been frozen for a few months and&&&&food
defrosted on the counter overnight&&&&ambience
It was too-sweet, canned cherries in a tasteless crust&&&&food
I don't know how they got these that sweet,&&&&food
If a 4 year old who is usually never allowed sweets cannot finish off dessert, there is a problem&&&&food
The decor is interesting for the kids&&&&ambience
But if I ever remember that the food is blah, I will avoid this place&&&&food
I just don't ever seem to remember it until I am sitting there eating it&&&&food
Food was decent, they were extremely busy though, on a Saturday afternoon and didn't seem to have enough staff&&&&food+service
I think I'd probably enjoy more during non-peak hours-the place was kind of a zoo, and all the staff seemed a little confused&&&&service
This time I just went for dessert and ordered an Oreo shake&&&&service
Service was fine, and it definitely has the 50s diner atmosphere&&&&food+service
They even have mini juke boxes at each table and you can pick a song for a quarter I think&&&&ambience
If you are looking for a late eat besides the 24-hour Mexican joint, this may work&&&&food
Open until 10 Sun-Thu, and until 11&&&&service
Or, the one on 16th St in Phoenix is open 24 hrs&&&&service
I have been to other 5 & DIner restaurants and enjoyed my meal, especially the one at the Scottsdale Pavillions&&&&food
Today's lunch was a terrible affair&&&&ambience
30PM and there was maybe only two or three tables occupied&&&&ambience
What we'd hoped would mean quick service was anything&&&&food+service
It took forever to get a waitress to take our order, and&&&&service
I ordered a bacon cheeseburger (was not asked about how done I wanted it, what kind of cheese or anything -- just boom, bacon cheeseburger, NEXT) and my fiancee ordered the chicken finger appetizer&&&&food+service
My burger was beyond well done, and dry,&&&&food
greasy from the cheese and sauces&&&&ambience+food
Furthermore the burger was cold -- and not just from the lettuce&&&&ambience+food
I choked it down with the aid of some decent fries&&&&food
M'lady's chicken fingers were mistakenly upgraded to a dinner plate, which included fries, corn on the cob, a biscuit, and gravy&&&&ambience+food
So we basically paid double for an order for too much food because the waitress -- or cook -- didn't get the order right&&&&cost+food+service
I now understand why there were so few people eating there as well&&&&food
They have really great chocolate shakes, so good we went back a second time just for them&&&&food
Only disappointment was the biscuits - tasted a little rubbery and right out of the microwave, otherwise a solid place for a meal&&&&food
We love the feel and the food of a genuine 50's diner&&&&food
I ordered the sliders&&&&service
Here's my opinion folks for what it is worth&&&&cost
Whenever I have ordered sliders ANYWHERE in the country the sliders have always come THREE to an order&&&&service
This one was only two small burgers with a mountain of fries to compensate&&&&food
The fries were good don't get me wrong&&&&food
There was only meat and cheese on them&&&&food
The onions and tomato were on the side and they were raw instead of cooked onions&&&&ambience+food
Traditional sliders come with chopped grilled onions on them&&&&food
Also my wife ordered a chocolate malt&&&&food+service
It tasted more like a chocolate sunday instead of a malt&&&&food
Service was just okay&&&&food+service
We had to wait an inordinate amount of time to be served and also for our check to get out of there&&&&cost
It was WAY HOT in there and we had to ask to have them turn on the A/C&&&&ambience+food
They turned on the ceiling fans without the A/C and we were still uncomfortable&&&&ambience
I would strongly recommend that if you want the look and feel of a genuine 50's diner with food and service to match that you go elsewhere&&&&ambience+food+service
-choose one of the innocuous seeming egg and potatoes breakfasts, w/ biscuits and a side order of gravy&&&&ambience+food+service
75, and you may think it will all fit on one plate&&&&ambience
However, you'll quickly note that there's twice as many hash-browns as anywhere else, and the food is incredibly fresh&&&&ambience+food
service and coffee is great too&&&&food+service
the food here is pretty much all good&&&&food
so much the chips turn soggy real quick&&&&food
However they have odd things like deep fried pickles which are delicious and their breakfast foods are super delicious&&&&food
The staff is wonderful and we are never left for wanting to say the least&&&&service
Some of them actually recognize us by face which is nice&&&&food
The restaurant itself is really nice, some of the seats are a bit beat up&&&&food
otherwise it's always really clean and they have mini juke boxes at each table and you get 2 songs for a quarter so bring your change&&&&ambience
Unless you hate 50s music that is&&&&ambience
It's also all 50 decor inside so if you're looking for a nostalgic place, this is the place to go&&&&ambience
As for the shakes, everyone is right in saying they are awesome and they're HUGE&&&&ambience
Over all, I'd highly suggest this place and also you can ask for the discount cards so if you get 7 meals, you get 1 free&&&&cost
It's not very pricey either which is a plus&&&&cost+food
This is one of my favorite breakfast and lunch spots in the Valley, and I am surprised by many of the negative reviews it has received&&&&ambience
They serve great breakfast burritos and pancakes, and a wide variety of omelets&&&&food
Their coffee is good enough&&&&food
Here's a useful bit of information for my fellow Chicagoans&&&&ambience
5 & Diner serves Vienna pure beef hot dogs&&&&ambience+food
My personal lunch favorite, my main reason for giving them five stars, is their veggie burger, which I order with green chile, no cheese, and a side of french fries&&&&food+service
Be sure to ask for the Cholula hot sauce&&&&ambience+food
This is a great casual dining spot with a classic diner motif and golden oldies playing regularly to accompany your meal&&&&ambience+food
This place is open earlier than other breakfast spots in the area&&&&ambience+service
The food is standard, nothing amazing&&&&food
The atmosphere is fun and the music gets you going&&&&ambience
The service is S L O W&&&&food+service
We asked for the bill after we ordered to expedite the process,&&&&cost+service
He payed a lot of attention to the people ordering off the senior menu, I guess he thought the old folks would tip better?? Anywho&&&&cost+service
My boyfriend and I stopped in to 5 & Diner after he picked me up at the airport and I was starving for some breakfast&&&&ambience
it was bacon and eggs with biscuits and gravy&&&&food
MMMM all of my favorite foods on a plate&&&&ambience+food
with a chocolate milkshake&&&&food
The biscuits were nice and fluffy,&&&&food
the bacon could have been a bit crispier&&&&food
It's a nice Denny's/IHOP alternative&&&&food
Good, quick service,&&&&food+service
it was fairly empty at 10 AM on a Wednesday&&&&ambience
We were sat right away and drinks came soon after&&&&food
Several employees walked by, each time seeming to look the other way&&&&service
As if to say,"You're not my table"&&&&ambience
Finally a guy came over (may have been the manager) and said,"what can I get you?" That's it&&&&service
No "Hi" or "are you ready to order?"&&&&service
I would've left since I was already annoyed at how long we were ignored for (I've done that before, you can tell when you're about to get crappy service)&&&&food+service
Fries were pretty good&&&&food
Service continued to suck&&&&food+service
My family likes to eat out as a treat once/twice a week&&&&food
When we find a place that has great food AND great service, we come back&&&&food+service
back when bars closed at 1am&&&&ambience+service
Anyway, I order the breakfast special for $4&&&&service
99 which is basically bacon and eggs and it was great, the hash browns were brown and crispy, eggs cooked perfect, bacon crispy, and the toast was like what I used to eat when i was a kid&&&&food
the small bread&&&&food
Yep, i was pleased and the service was fantastic&&&&food+service
The atmosphere and decor is very casual and its 50's style with the music and all&&&&ambience
this place worked out nice this morning&&&&food
I was originally thinking fries and a patty melt when we decided on going there,&&&&food
when we looked at the menu the breakfast food looked extra delicious, so I went for the waffle with strawberries, and my boyfriend got the country fried steak and eggs and a vanilla coke&&&&food
As I'm writing this, he asked me to specifically mention that the vanilla coke was super yummy, so I'm doing that now before I forget&&&&food
)  My waffle hit the spot, it was a nice texture and the yummy sweet strawberry topping was just what I wanted&&&&ambience+food
My boyfriend cleared his plate, as well&&&&ambience
Our server was super attentive and friendly, and even gave my boyfriend his last refill to go so we could take it on the road with us&&&&service
All in all, a very positive experience, especially considering this type of diner usually has mediocre food&&&&food
As a side note, I had been here once before a long, long time ago, and had the patty melt and that was awesome as well&&&&ambience
As a side side note, I don't know what the person who said the dining room smells like a bathroom is talking about&&&&ambience
Food was delicious, every item we had was fantastic&&&&food
Took a while for the food to get to our table, and when it was busy we didn't see our server for about 25 minutes&&&&ambience+food
Decided to eat with friends after watching Harry Potter&&&&ambience+food
Cana Latin Kitchen bar dishes are served just like Firefly restaurant, in small servings so one dish will not fill you up&&&&ambience
It's set that way so you can have the opportunity to taste other things on the menu without getting full&&&&food
Stepping inside, the atmosphere was dark and intimate, a good place to take out a date to talk and drink wine together&&&&ambience+food+service
The LCD tv at the center of the bar kind of ruins that mood a bit though&&&&ambience
Monday night football was on and no one was really paying attention to it because everyone was involved in their own intimate private conversation and having one tv in this type of setup just doesn't blend in well&&&&ambience+cost+service
I'll give the service a good review&&&&food+service
I ordered the mixto ceviche (shrimp, scallop and calimari)&&&&food+service
The tortilla came separate with it which were served in potato chips size pieces&&&&ambience+cost+food
Taste was ok&&&&food
thats because I prefer my ceviche with a heavy lime taste&&&&food
I also ordered the fish taco which came in 3 small pieces&&&&food+service
I tasted my friends tuna ceviche too which I recommend to anyone that comes here&&&&food
It was the best dish we had on our table&&&&ambience
Great way to end a night if you don't feel like partying in the neighboring bars and just in a mood to have a quiet place to eat and have a conversation&&&&ambience+food
Ambiance- This place is very nice, warm and cozy&&&&ambience+food
The place is dimly lit which I  am personally comfortable with&&&&ambience
The bar area is nice and the tables are spaced evenly throughout the restaurant&&&&ambience+food
Food- I came here the night before Easter Sunday&&&&food
So, I was not able to try any of the meat dishes&&&&food
The food is a bit disappointing&&&&food
After you have the tapas at Firefly, it is difficult  to match the quality, quantity and taste of the food&&&&ambience+food
Location-The location is great&&&&food
Across from Blue Martini and steps away from the movie theaters&&&&food
Town square is a great location&&&&food
Price- A bit on the steep side&&&&cost+food
You cannot really expect much because of the expensive rent  these places have to pay at Town Square&&&&cost
Service - It is OK, nothing special&&&&food+service
Great food and friendly people&&&&food+service
The sugarcane sangria is delicious($5 on happy hour)&&&&food
The original Mojito on the other hand was not&&&&food
I had the habanero pepper jack and cheese, it was VERY SMALL and tasted not too much different than Kraft Mac&Cheese&&&&food
all I could taste was the truffle oil&&&&food
overpriced&&&&cost+food
Overall, the restaurant is beautiful and the patio is great as it looks over townsquare park&&&&food
Definitely not a place to enjoy a nice meal or even some appetizers with a drink&&&&food
A nice location sandwiched between Bar Louie and Blue Martini at Town Square&&&&ambience+food
I have to say that this should be "the" spot of the summer (for drinks)&&&&ambience+food
Additionally, throw in the mojitos and tapas and we have the perfect summer spot&&&&ambience+food
The bartenders were a little slow and unresponsive&&&&ambience+food
seeing the work it takes to make a mojito, I understand&&&&food
What was strange was the managers that stood around and did nothing&&&&service
later found out they were managers who just got in the way of the servers and the customers&&&&service
and I don't even like sweet drinks&&&&food
But the food was very subpar&&&&food
As a matter of fact we ordered about ten different items on the menu and maybe the only thing that stood out was the mushroom ceviche and the dates with bacon (even though Firefly's is better&&&&ambience+food+service
how do you mess up something with bacon wrapped around it anyway)&&&&food
eh and will not have me running back there to eat&&&&food
With places that have waaaaayyyy better food within walking distance (Johhny McGuire's, Yardhouse, Bar Louie, and even Cadillac Ranch) I'd rather eat somewhere else and afterwards go grab a couple drinks at night here&&&&ambience+food
I love Cana's mojitos which are muddled with fresh fruit and real sugar cane&&&&ambience+food
Every time my friends and I come here, we either get the empanadas, beef tenderloin, slider dogs, classico ceviche, tuna ceviche, or the fish tacos&&&&food
Happy Hour prices are amazing&&&&cost+food
You can eat pretty well for fairly cheap&&&&ambience+cost+food
The service has ALWAYS been excellent here&&&&food+service
My work colleague and i decided to try Cana because of the 1/2 off mojitos&&&&food
I tried the strawberry, original, cucumber mojitos&&&&food
I had two strawberry&&&&food
The small plates were also delectable&&&&ambience
And we even ordered the churros for desert&&&&service
The waitress was awesome and one of the chefs even dropped by&&&&ambience
I'm surprised this place is getting such great ratings&&&&food
After much persistance, I convinced the host to just reserve me a table anyway&&&&ambience
When I arrived, my party wasn't there yet, so I took my table because the bar was full&&&&ambience
I wasn't offered a beverage for quite some time&&&&food
When my friends arrived, they received warm water with no ice in a sticky glass&&&&ambience+food
We ordered 3 dishes after waiting quite some time for our waitress&&&&service
After about 20 minutes, the waitress told us that the chef had just informed her they were out of salmon&&&&food
Did she wait 20 minutes to put in the order? People around us were getting food&&&&food+service
Flavor was terrible, no spice at all&&&&food
The texture was even worse&&&&food
Next we received the item that we substituted for the salmon, which was a crab ceviche&&&&food
Completely over salted, and was more like tuna than crab&&&&food
When the waitress described it to us, she mentioned it was the special of the night which came with a salad&&&&food
There was no salad&&&&food
This one was at least slightly tasty compared to the others,&&&&ambience+food
I contemplated dessert,&&&&ambience
I would hate for them to suffer through this meal&&&&ambience
Service - poor, food - poor, drinks - poor&&&&food+service
I will say, however, that the place is decorated nicely&&&&ambience+cost+food
I just wouldn't eat&&&&food
Not sure this place will stay open long, it was pretty empty when we went, and, in the words of the hostess, reservations aren't really needed&&&&service
I didn't try much of their menu, save for their beef empenadas&&&&food
I found them to be tasty and well cooked&&&&food
Since I stuck with that, the pricing was respectable&&&&ambience
I had also tried their "Fire Water" drink based off the name alone, and I found it to be enjoyable as well&&&&food
A bit of a small glass,&&&&ambience
the flavor was good&&&&food
I don't want to rate it any higher on the grounds that I only had one menu and drink selection, and they were more of a quick snack than a full meal,&&&&cost+food
It was my first time trying ceviche so, it could be like Beatles, Sgt Peppers being your first album&&&&food
But if you do not love this place you are missing a key part of your "foodie" DNA&&&&food
This restaurant is the answer to every time you've said "I wish I could try 5 plates"&&&&ambience
Tapas is small plates of each&&&&ambience
If you are going once I'd recommend trying the ceviche, piggy back dates in goat cheese mouse, shrimp in chicharran sauce, short ribs and save room for homemade churros or that chocolate kiss with sea salt and chipotle sauce (?&&&&ambience+food
?) - Hamachi ceviche - for those rookies like me&&&&food
this is like sashimi/fish "cooked" in citrus by the acid&&&&food
I've never had pickled hot peppers&&&&ambience+food
its like sweet hot tangy awesomeness&&&&ambience+food
(is it obvious I'm not a professional reviewer?) Shrimp in chicharran sauce - crispy shrimp (they use 3 flours) with a little bit of pop&&&&food
Short ribs -- one large short rib in guava glaze&&&&food
Its probably the best bbq sauce with rich, slightly tangy,&&&&ambience+food
smooth flavor&&&&food
The meat was fall off the bone tender&&&&food
Piggy back dates -- a must have&&&&food
dates wrapped in bacon with an almond inside for some pop and&&&&food
I could eat these on the coach all day&&&&food
- Mojitos - I have to admit I didn't have&&&&food
was with 10 people and the mixed drinks and variations on the mojito shocked people&&&&food
"Not as sweet" as most&&&&food
Lastly, service was perfect as you'd expect the timing for each dish to be difficult&&&&food+service
Gun to my head I'd say I didn't like the chicken skewers&&&&food
Yes the have mac and cheese&&&&food
Piggy back dates with almonds and white mousse? Can you picture what that taste like? There's something for everyone here&&&&food
Ceviche, mac and cheese, shrimp, pickled jalapenos, bread pudding&&&&food
this might be the best meal I ever had" I felt like I was trying to find something I didn't find mindblowing to seem credible when I told friends about it&&&&food
I'll wait for Cana NYC to open up&&&&service
Went with the hirame ceviche which was was done w/ lavender, lychee and lime&&&&food
Interesting mix for a ceviche and tasty&&&&food
We also ordered the beef empanadas and the cuban sliders which were both very good&&&&food+service
Atmosphere is awesome&&&&ambience
Great place for drinks and this place is gonna rock when the weather gets warmer&&&&ambience+food
Really wanted this to be a great place&&&&food
Sure looks good inside & I have to say the service was great&&&&food+service
However I found the food way over priced and the portions small (Yeah I know Tapas are small plates)&&&&ambience+cost+food
from $12-$14 give me some meat&&&&food
Drinks were tasty & I enjoyed the white sangria over the red&&&&food
again pricey&&&&cost+food
Lower your price or increase the portion size&&&&cost+food
I'm not cheap by any means&&&&cost+service
We were going to grab some sushi&&&&food
hadn't noticed Caña before and wanted to try it seeing as we're fans of tapas&&&&food
Lots of small plates meant to be shared&&&&ambience+service
We ordered a salad, meatballs, hamachi ceviche, crab ceviche, churros, Cuban sliders, ahi tuna flatbread, and several drinks&&&&ambience+food+service
Drinks were great&&&&food
Food was excellent&&&&food
The hamachi was sliced sashimi style with an delicious dressing&&&&food
Crab was more like a crab salad and had a metallic taste as if it were canned&&&&food
The crab ceviche was the only dish that wasn't excellent&&&&food
Service is good&&&&food+service
Can't wait for the weather to warm up so we can try the outside patios&&&&ambience+food
Went here on a Friday night- very nice vibe, sangria and mojito were yummy (should've listened to our waitress and got a pitcher for $28 since we ended up ordering that much in drinks anyways&&&&food+service
)We liked the decor and feel of the restaurant- made us kinda feel like we were back home in SF at the XYZ Bar at the W Hotel&&&&ambience+food
We ordered beef tenderloin, lamb chops, mac n cheese and hali&&&&food+service
The beef tenderloin was good, portion was fine for the two of us&&&&food
The mac n cheese was REALLY good&&&&food
The lamb chops were perfectly cooked and great flavor&&&&food
The ceviche was fresh and came with a shot glass of sauce that you can put the hali&&&&ambience+food
Overall, service was good we would come back for happy hour next time since we ended up spending a little over $100 for two&&&&food+service
My new favorite bar /hangout spot in the city of Las Vegas&&&&ambience
*Well crafted, DELICIOUS drinks&&&&food
I know we all love those sugary mojitos at Firefly,&&&&food
the flavorings are all just powders and artificial&&&&food
The fruit mojitos here are muddled with real fresh fruit - they used a half pint of blueberries on one freaking mojito that I watched them make&&&&ambience+food
*Service is exponentially better&&&&food+service
The bartenders will actually take the time to get to know you and make sure you love your drink&&&&ambience+food
My mojito gets thrown at me with no hello at FireFly*Atmosphere&&&&food
Happy hour is till 7, instead of ending at 6 PM like it does on FF on Paradise&&&&food
--------------------------I've said it once and I'll say it again - the drinks are awesome and they are why I come here&&&&ambience+food
The mojitos are muddled with fresh fruit, and they have some awesome martinis&&&&ambience+food
We tried their best selling yellowtail ceviche and while it was fresh, I don't like their funky new style&&&&ambience+food
If I want ceviche I want small pieces of fish, not 4 huge ugly slabs&&&&food
On the flip side, we really loved the beef empanadas&&&&food
The mac and cheese is great as are the sliders&&&&food
The flat breads and shrimp are both great and hearty portions to boot&&&&ambience+food
A pretty damn big slab for $12 and covered in the most delicious sauce&&&&food
It's more sophisticated and the drinks are way better&&&&food
Daily 5-7PM, 12-2am26 items $5 or less (food and drink)The Peach Sangria was great, my girflriend immediately tried to recreate it at home&&&&food
With $5 plates, it definitely puts it into my price range, and I plan on coming back&&&&ambience+cost+food
Grand opening tonight&&&&service
Cute place and the food was terrific&&&&food
We sat out on the patio to enjoy the nice night and because they only allowed happy hour specials at the bar/patio&&&&ambience+food
However, we would rather sit out there because it was just too dark in the dining area&&&&ambience
These are the tapas we ordered&&&&service
-Mac and cheese with the habenero&&&&food
The habenero gave this tapa a lil kick and was a wonderful compliment&&&&food
-Beef empanadas-this was everyone's favorite&&&&food
Was light and fluffy with ground beef and other spices in the middle&&&&ambience+food
yum-Chicken empanada-not as good as the beef empanadas,&&&&food
-Spicy tuna ceviche-one of us doesn't eat sushi/sashimi,&&&&food
she thought this was delicious&&&&food
I honestly thought it was a bit too fishy while everyone else liked it&&&&food
-Hamachi tiradito-the citrus brought out the flavor of this fish&&&&ambience+food
Was light and refreshing&&&&ambience+food
-Cuban Sliders-ham on top of pork, was kinda boring to me&&&&food
I like cuban sandwiches when there is a dipping sauce&&&&food
This one doesn't come with a dipping sauce&&&&food
-Crispy Shrimp-one said that this reminds her of honey walnut shrimp, I didn't care too much for it&&&&food
The shrimps were tiny&&&&food
-Beef taco-Better than the fish, not as good as the chicken taco&&&&food
The portion seem to be tiny for the amount of pickled cabbage given&&&&cost+food
-Chicken taco-Taste the best out of the three kinds of taco&&&&food
The pickled purple cabbage and a slice of jalapeno tasted very good with this chicken taco&&&&food
-Fish taco-least favorite&&&&food
the fish was BORING&&&&food
Didn't taste like much&&&&food
It was so soft and fluffy, with a nice vanilla sauce (I think) drizzled on top of it&&&&food
A rectangular baked dough on a dish of honey and powdered sugar&&&&food
Even for non-drinkers as myself&&&&food
Blackberry mojito-Was on the tart side&&&&food
So, happy hour is definitely the time to go to try out many different tapas and drink the sugarcane sangria&&&&food
went to cana for happy hour and they had some really good specials, $5 mojitos and beers&&&&food
the mojito was EXCELLENT&&&&food
we also got the mac-n-cheese with habanero seasoning, nice size portion, and it was very good&&&&food
small portions for the price, we got the trio ceviche spicy tuna (great taste), scallop (with mango and pomegranate seeds), and the mixit (shrimp & octopus) they were each like 2 - 3 bites and it was like $30 bucks, not worth it for the price&&&&cost+food
Last night was my second time trying Cana, and quite frankly its not worth the money&&&&cost
My boyfriend and I got a pitcher of mojiots, empanadas, and a sorry excuse for a flatbread which was basically three slices of pita bread with a little smudge of melted cheese in the center&&&&ambience+food
no sauce, no flavor&&&&food
This cost us $75 after tip&&&&cost
The only reason I gave two stars as opposed to one, is because I saw the bartender totally hook it up in our pitcher of mojito&&&&ambience+food
But, needless to say, we met up with friends right after this, and immediately walked over to Brio for some hearty pasta, breads, and salads&&&&food
Seriously, go to Firefly if you want tapas, this place is only good for drinks&&&&food
Nice, vibrant environment&&&&ambience+food
The server was very friendly in telling us what we should try and most were accurate&&&&cost+service
Everyone raves about the pork sliders,&&&&food
we found them to be very dry&&&&food
needed a little more mustard or BBQ sauce in my opinion (cough cough&&&&food
another drink please&&&&food
Drinks were great as she made sure we never ran dry&&&&food
Overall, great place&&&&food
This spot is not right down in the Strip&&&&ambience
My guess it will be more locals, and shoppers as the restaurant is located in the very nice Town Square (http&&&&food
Tapa style plates&&&&ambience
Lychee/lime/lavenderThe flatbread pizza&&&&ambience+food
Grilled Chicken/mango/cilantro/queso blancoThe Mac & Cheese&&&&food
with Habaner jace (my favorite)The Lamb Chops&&&&food
with mint chimichurri (okay, also my favorite)Tried two of the three desserts&&&&food
Bread Pudding with banana/rum sauce and the Chocolate Kiss, with Chipolte Foam&&&&food
Service was outstanding, this was the second night they were open&&&&food+service
Very friendly&&&&service
Atmosphere was nice/modern/chic, I could use a brighter candle on the table&&&&ambience+food
i had to use my iphone for light to read the menu&&&&ambience
they noticed right away, and said they would be working on it&&&&food
low lighting, dark woods, modern feel, one big open room with tables plus outdoor patio seating which looked like it would be a great way to go in the Fall and Spring&&&&ambience+food+service
1-page for drinks and 1-page for food What's cool is that they keep it simple&&&&food
and if you're vegetarian this is NOT the place for you&&&&food
I think there were 2 items on the menu that did not have meat or were meat based Downside&&&&food
2 wines - out of 2 of the 8 beers - out of the short rib tacos and some other dish that I can't remember Taste&&&&food
everything we ordered was very tasty and well executed with a flair for presentation&&&&ambience+food+service
so each plate is good for 2 people&&&&ambience
we often ordered multiples&&&&service
Chicken Empanadas (now these were on the big side)&&&&food
Chicken Tacos&&&&food
Fish Tacos&&&&food
Crispy Shrimp Dessert&&&&food
If you like bread pudding&&&&food
try their Banana Bread Pudding&&&&food
) We also ordered the Churros which were more like Cinnamon twists&&&&food+service
very good as well and I dipped the churros in the sauce the BBP came in&&&&food
Our waiter was cool&&&&service
super busy as it seemed like he was only 1 of 2 guys taking care of all the tables and it was a pretty busy night&&&&ambience
almost all the tables were filled plus a big party of 10 The hostess was&&&&ambience
she wasn't mean&&&&service
she wasn't friendly either so&&&&service
I ordered the raspberry mojito&&&&food+service
it was way too sweet&&&&food
I like the chunks of fruit in my muddled mojito&&&&food
it too was sweet&&&&food
so let's just say this drink would be perfect for sitting by the pool&&&&food
refreshing and delightful&&&&ambience+food
Ok the service at the bar Not so attentive for patron rather they are more interested in what is happening in their lives, second the food it was ok the best is the empenada, THE WORST is the MEAT BAllS please owners read this remove it and fire your cook&&&&ambience+food+service
it tasted like it was boiled in BBQ sauce for 20hrs, bcuz melted in your mouth, not so great&&&&food
The hamachi ceviche is my favorite&&&&food
The dates with goat cheese mousse were awesome too, along with the sangria&&&&ambience+food
We asked for the dates sans bacon and they were delicious--crisp and perfectly baked&&&&food
Much better than Firefly where the dates are served soaking in a bowl of bacon grease (although I have to admit that Firefly introduced me to this dish so I shoudln't complain)&&&&ambience+food
The best part about my experience was the service&&&&food+service
John is an amazing bar tender&&&&ambience+food
All of the bartenders are very friendly and focused on the customer&&&&ambience+food+service
They were genuinely interested in whether or not we liked our food and drinks&&&&food
John introduced us to Cory, the owner, who is also a friendly, genuine person&&&&service
I don't think you'll find better service anywhere in Vegas, really&&&&food+service
I have been going to Firefly for years and have never left feeling like the employees knew me or cared about my return&&&&service
I can't wait to go here when the weather gets nice too--large windows open up to the bar--it's a great indoor/outdoor space&&&&ambience+food+service
Even though it was rainy and cold this Saturday, it was a fun place to be&&&&ambience+food
overpriced tapas&&&&cost+food
Compared to Firefly they can't hold a candle to it&&&&ambience
The only redeeming food they have is the mushroom ceviche&&&&food
That was delicious&&&&food
If the happy hour is cheap I'll go check it out and give them a star if it's a good deal&&&&cost
Prior to that, we were at the Blue Martini, so this place was a real nice break from speakers that 'go to eleven'&&&&food
it's only been open a few weeks&&&&service
The bartender's were great&&&&ambience+food
Awesome mojitos and really great food&&&&ambience+food
We had the chicken skewers, meatballs and churros&&&&food
Everything was really flavorful and unique&&&&food
The bartenders were extremely nice and friendly&&&&ambience+food+service
A really nice break from the usual 'Strip' stuff&&&&food
Since we had time to kill before a flick we decided to eat here&&&&food
After all, tapas is a nice way to eat lots without feeling like a pig&&&&food
We ordered a plethora of dishes, and I have to say that this place is pretty good,&&&&service
the meat was overpowered by some serious guava jelly&&&&food
I did break a glass on my way out,&&&&ambience
they were nice about it&&&&food
We got spicy tune ceviche&&&&food
amazing especially with the chip thingys they bring out with it, beef emenadas&&&&food
the crust is super flaky and yummy, mac n cheese&&&&food
SO good and surprisingly spicy, and the meatballs&&&&food
Our waiter even gave us a sample of the white sangria which was also good&&&&service
This review is not about the food&&&&food
As we arrived, we are told by the hostess that we cannot be seated inside since the place was booked by a very large group&&&&ambience+food
I asked if there was a comfortable area outside since I was still cold from seating outside in the shade on a very windy day at Blue Martini&&&&ambience+food
We get outside and we asked to sit at the only table located in the sun&&&&ambience
As we are looking at the menu and finally warm up, the hostess comes back to our table and asked us to move to another table in the shade since apparently, the table in the sun is going to be used by the big party&&&&ambience
We ended up going to Nu right downstairs and were seated on the patio right next to a very pretty and warm fire pit&&&&ambience+food
Just received a nice message from Cana management&&&&food
Regards,Cory"I replied that there were some request for new / additional drinks&&&&food+service
Since Cana uses Rum and Sugar Cane in the majority of their drinks,     why not add some Polynesian drinks? A Mai-Tai made with Sugar     Cane as sweetener would sound deliciouso right about now&&&&ambience+food
One of the best Iced Teas I've ever had was at a restaurant in     Sacramento where the Iced Tea (not the Long Island kind) was made    with Sugar Caner&&&&food
that sounds good in the Summertime in     Vegas&&&&ambience
Great sangria, and the sliders are tasty&&&&food
Good place to hang out, just a little pricey&&&&cost+food
I was very impressed with the waiter and the owner who were so welcoming and impressive with telling of what they enjoyed and the care that went into food preparation&&&&food+service
I had far more food that I normally do&&&&food
Hamachi - fresh and zestyDuck Empanada - delicious unique&&&&ambience+food
ter crust and sweet to biteMac N Cheese - so bad for you&&&&food
so good when it hits your lipsCalamari - crispy and peppery and using the dipping sauce really adds to the flavorPork Chops - Loved the marinade, tender, and full of flavorBread Pudding - This hit all my senses as soon as it hit the table and really lived up to expectationsChurros - Best churro I've ever had, arrived warm and hot and the glaze just really made the flavor jump in you mouth&&&&ambience+food
My friend had the white wine sangria and was very satisfied which is quite the compliment since she's very discerning&&&&food
I had a faux-jito, which was equally flavorful and fun&&&&food
Overall it was a great experience, nice ambiance, great service, and a welcome spot for friends, dates, and even business dinners&&&&ambience+food+service
Cana has some tasty food,&&&&food
Most dishes hover right above $10, and the portions certainly do not match what you're paying for&&&&ambience+cost
Happy hour is from 5pm-7pm daily and gets you the following items at discount price (discount prices are listed below, and are approx&&&&cost+food
~50% off full price, plus or minus $1)&&&&cost+food
Beef Empanadas, $6&&&&food
Ground beef with some veggies inside pastry bread&&&&food
I'll eat it&&&&food
it's not my first choice&&&&food
Mac & Cheese, $4&&&&food
00 - This is some tasty mac & cheese, using white cheese, cheddar cheese and some habanero&&&&food
The kick from the habanero makes this something that I would order every visit&&&&service
00 - These are delicious little burgers&&&&food
Made with ground pork, with a little ham thrown on top just because&&&&food
They've been juicy and full of flavor every time I've ordered these (which happens to be every time I've been here)&&&&food+service
Order comes with three sliders, which are small to begin with&&&&service
Not worth full price&&&&cost+food
Crispy Shrimp, $6&&&&food
00 - Yes, it is pieces of shrimp&&&&food
Yes, it was probably crunchy at some time with some sort of breading&&&&food
But no, it is not crispy when it arrives&&&&food
Last night was the first time I ordered it, and the sauce it comes with (panko?) made the shrimp soggy&&&&food+service
It had a citrus flavor and wasn't bad,&&&&food
I can't see myself ordering it again&&&&service
Chicken Skewers, $? - The fifth and final food item on the happy hour menu&&&&food
I didn't order it last night&&&&service
It's not my favorite drink so I didn't order&&&&food+service
During my visits it seems that on average people are paying roughly $15-$20 per person depending on who gets drinks&&&&ambience+cost+food
When I go to Firefly with a group it's usually about $20 per person and the food is tastier, with more generous portions&&&&food+service
Cana's food is good from what I've tasted so far,&&&&food
the prices are scaring me off from trying the other items, no matter how good they look&&&&ambience+cost+food
The point is share the food tapas style&&&&food
when you get tiny morsels of food (from $12+ a plate) its barely enough for one person to enjoy&&&&ambience+food
(4 pieces of fish the size of quarters is $16??) Please&&&&food
The service was good, and the ambiance is contemporary and inviting, however it's not the kind of place to indulge in, just feeling like snacking and paying $70 a person for basically an appetizer&&&&cost+food+service
The mojitos here are delicious&&&&food
I love the original and the cucumber version&&&&food
The food is decent&&&&food
I've tried the mac-n-cheese (a bit spicy,&&&&food
yummy), the flatbread (kinda bland, nothing special), the bacon wrapped dates (yummy,&&&&ambience+food
you can only eat a couple before they are just too sweet), and the papas (very tasty)&&&&food
sure I don't like super crowded places,&&&&ambience
The mojitos will keep me coming back, and hopefully a following will build for this place so it's a little more lively in the future&&&&food
Not only the food is delicious, the drinks are unique and yummy, the decor is modern and comfortable, and the staff is very helpful when it comes to explaining the menu and giving suggestions&&&&ambience+food+service
This says a lot, because my boyfriend and I eat out often and it's hard to find a place that makes me want to come back time after time&&&&food
Cana's tapas are ALL delicious&&&&food
Beef empanadas, hali&&&&food
Anyways, their drinks are also amazing&&&&food
Fresh sugarcane&&&&ambience+food
DELICIOUS and consistently good every time&&&&food
Awesome Food, great prices, and best service in town&&&&ambience+cost+food+service
All drinks made fresh, try the mojitos&&&&ambience+food
)  To top it off have a chocolate kiss or a churro, they are outstanding&&&&food
Waitress was talking with some people at the other side of the bar&&&&ambience
I ask about Mojito, Seviche classic,&&&&food
only two girls and a guy at the bar talking on my left side and just me, in front of that TV, watching "Jeopardy&&&&ambience
I just start  seeping my Mojito and forgot about the game&&&&food
Minutes later came the seviche (tiny and good), and a second Mojito&&&&food
, just after 20-30 min after my first request, the bartender ask one of the guys working in the kitchen how to find the soccer game on "&&&&ambience+food
the TV audio was OFF=MUTE=SILENT (natural, in a bar environments, right?) and the waitress was swapping channels, back and forward, until I said, "STOP&&&&ambience
,  she said the most interesting part of her appearance that night&&&&food
Caña is located in the spot vacated by Louis's Fish Camp and they did a great job of remodeling the space&&&&ambience+food
Louis's had a small bar and the entry way was a little odd -- kinda felt like you were walking in through the back door to get into the restaurant because of the small door, walking by the bathrooms and getting a glimpse of the "behind the bar" area before getting to the dining area&&&&ambience
With Caña, the doorway is larger and more inviting and the bar is pushed back, adjoining the patio areas&&&&ambience
The interior of the place is much darker and intimate as well&&&&ambience+service
As for the food&&&&food
- Hamachi ceviche -- as other reviews have mentioned they are not traditional ceviches&&&&food
They're more like sashimi slices laying on a streak of citrus sauce&&&&food
Hardly enough citrus to 'cook' the hamachi&&&&food
It didn't taste all that fresh and lacked flavor&&&&ambience+food
- Short ribs -- one large short rib in a deep pool of guava glaze&&&&food
The meat was very tender&&&&food
didn't have much depth in flavor&&&&food
A few more spices would have given it some kick and made this a great dish,&&&&food
the meat all on its own was a little dull&&&&ambience+food
- Piggy back dates -- It seems like every tapas/bocadillos place HAS to have bacon wrapped dates&&&&food
Great textures (although the amount of goat cheese mousse was overkill) and great flavors&&&&cost+food
- Beef empanadas -- the outside of the empanadas was flaky and a little crispy&&&&food
The inside could have used more beef&&&&food
Almost every bite was pastry with a hint of beef&&&&food
The beef tasted pretty good, I just wanted more of it&&&&food
- Crispy shrimp -- decent flavor, not as crispy as I would have liked&&&&food
- Sangria -- while it did taste good, it wasn't strong enough and was too sweet&&&&food
We sat at the bar on a Saturday night and didn't have any trouble finding seats&&&&ambience+food
The service was very good&&&&food+service
Our bartender was on top of things and we didn't have to wait long for drinks or food even though he and the other bartenders were very busy (all those mojitos take a while to make)&&&&ambience+food
Our bill came out to about $88 including tip for two people&&&&cost
However, I doubt I'll be back for the food&&&&food
Portion of foods are very small&&&&food
they are very taste =DDefinitely good place for small biters&&&&food
Atmosphere was great and their churus was absolutely the BEST&&&&food
We've lived in Vegas for a year and this was the worst food for the price we've had so far&&&&cost+food
We ordered the scallop ceviche, chicken flat bread, bacon wrapped dates, salad, and meatballs&&&&ambience+food+service
The scallops were chewy and fishy and the ceviche's ingredients had a bad mixture of texture&&&&food
The chicken flat bread was sparse&&&&ambience+food
The salad was served the same way as coleslaw and bacon wrapped dates were greasy (goat cheese sauce tasted like sour cream)&&&&ambience+food
The meatballs dish was the only dish that we liked&&&&food
I also ordered a glass of wine and it looked like it was two ounces&&&&ambience+service
Cana should change it's layout into a lounge instead of a restaurant because it's more about the ambiance and view&&&&food
The service was excellent and we tipped her accordingly&&&&food+service
I went with a friend and sat at the bar to eat&&&&ambience+food
We had to get the bartender's attention after being seated for about 5 mins, he was busy chatting with a friend at the other end of the bar&&&&ambience+food
We ordered cocktails and our food, we ordered their Meatballs, Spring Rolls, Mac & Cheese, and the Dates&&&&food+service
We ordered these because they're are favorites from Firefly so we could compare&&&&service
The food really felt like someone was reading receipts out of a cookbook and attempting to add their own "flair"&&&&ambience+food
And along with the mediocre food was the mediocre bartender, he literally left us with empty glasses for 10mins until we could get ahold of his bar back and had him actually make us drinks&&&&ambience+food
Firefly is still the king of Tapas Eateries in Las Vegas for me, Cana's was a disappointment&&&&food
The drinks are consistent, the food is so fresh and flavorful&&&&ambience+food
The weather is warming up so we are definitely looking forward to some warm nights on the patio&&&&ambience+food
They have a little lounge patio area with a few cushy seats that almost seems like my own private little living room&&&&food
This visit Cory (owner) stopped by the table and he gave us some previews of drinks he is creating for the summer menu&&&&ambience+food
(Which by the way is a selling point to this ADHD foodie&&&&food
new stuff on the menu is a big plus)  I can't talk too much about the spicy, savory, tasty drinks we tried&&&&food
There is also a new Sangria on the menu which is so refreshing and not too sweet&&&&ambience+food
Made with a Malbec and citrus juices (and Bacardi O) it is going to be the perfect complement to a warm Vegas breeze, swaying palm trees and ceviche&&&&ambience+food
They were soaking in a citrus marinade that made raw mushrooms absolutely tasty&&&&food
We also had the Spicy Tuna Ceviche and the Mixto made with shrimp, scallops, and calamari (they have an 'choose 3' offer that we couldn't resist)&&&&food
The 3 of those along with the Hamachi was almost enough for us&&&&food
But even before the ceviches were ordered I could smell the aroma of truffle coming from the table next to us (and NO I am not sick of truffles yet)&&&&ambience+service
Thin crispy waffle cut potato chips with grated parmesan and truffle oil&&&&ambience+cost+food
You know how some of us like the really brown potato chips and pick them out of the bags? Well, these chips were like those on steroids&&&&ambience+food
sorry, my eyes were closed and I was in Heaven so I don't really remember&&&&service
the Watermelon Ginger Margharita, the new Sangria, and the freakin' awesome Truffle Chips&&&&ambience+food
Nice easygoing ambiance with bold yet comforting modern decor of reds/browns/and touches of green&&&&ambience+food
Attentive service and delicious tapas dishes&&&&food+service
Highly recommend the Spicy Tuna Ceviche and the Cuban Sliders&&&&food
check-in on 4square for a drink special&&&&food
This place was great - good food, drinks (caipirinha) , happy-hour, and location&&&&food
I'm extremely optimistic that this place will earn 5 stars on my next visit when I intend to order off their regular menu&&&&service
Luckily the cordial manager Mike let us indulge in happy hour since their yelp ad lists happy hour from 4-7pm&&&&service
First off, their happy hour prices are so inexpensive&&&&cost+food
50, and a glass of wine for $3&&&&ambience
50? Absolutely awesome&&&&ambience
The watermelon gazpacho was pleasing,&&&&food
One bite would be incredibly delicious, and the next sort of bland&&&&food
Our cocktails were the highlight&&&&ambience
my father had Fire Water which was a really unique concoction that included Ctristal Aguardiente, a Columbian liquor&&&&food
The Diablo Dulce was exactly that, spicy and sweet- and utterly satisfying&&&&food
The Sugarcane sangria was really good, and really sweet&&&&food
ing sweetness&&&&food
Their Hamachi Tiradito was a winner, and entirely cooked as opposed to raw&&&&food
Raw might have been more delicious,&&&&food
However our server asked the chef who agreed to let us order from the dinner menu if there was something we were interested in (our group of 5)&&&&service
We stayed inside because it was a bit cold outside,&&&&ambience+food
the view (of Townsquare) from the deck looked nice&&&&food
My preliminary explanation is that people love sugar cane in their drinks&&&&food
I didn't have any sugar cane drinks&&&&food
I had a glass of wine and some food&&&&ambience+food
The atmosphere is dark and sexy and suave, and I do love a good atmosphere,&&&&ambience
at Cana you pay for the atmosphere&&&&cost
The food was expensive for tapas&&&&food
some of my friends did not think it was the freshest&&&&ambience+food
Then we had an $11 chicken flatbread&&&&ambience+food
For $11, I expected some mega-chicken and assorted toppings,&&&&food
there were maybe 9 little cubes of chicken and close to no mango that was promised on the menu&&&&food
The yucca frites were not too special, and the "crispy" $12 shrimp were not crispy at all&&&&food
They were a bit soggy&&&&food
Plus, most everything came to the table not hot&&&&ambience+food
I hate not hot tapas&&&&ambience+food
There was a manager type who appeared to be running dishes, when generally that is a task reserved for the waitstaff&&&&food+service
If I am at Town Square and someone wants to go back, I wouldn't be a party pooper&&&&ambience
However, for now and based on the other reviews, I would say go to Cana for the drinks,&&&&food
eat at Firefly&&&&food
The food at Firefly is 50% cheaper and 100% hotter&&&&ambience+cost+food
First of all, only certain drinks and food are happy hour priced&&&&cost+food
The server told us that it was cheaper getting the pitcher,&&&&cost
beware this is full price during happy hour&&&&cost+food
We also ordered the Mac and Cheese and the Chicken Empanada (this is not a HH item)&&&&food+service
one thing you will always get from me is an open mind and minimum negativity unless it is truly called for&&&&service
her reccomendations we welcomed with open arms&&&&service
We started first of course with some drinks&&&&food
My boo ordered a strawberry basil margherita&&&&food+service
" I order a cucumber mojito&&&&food+service
I like a stiff drink&&&&food
mine was a little rough&&&&ambience
It was different it had some rum pineapple juice habenero and garlic&&&&food
We went on to order the chicken empanadas&&&&food+service
they were the perfect amount of flaky and crunchy&&&&cost+food
not too much oil&&&&food
after that we had the spicy tuna chiviche&&&&food
We had the "hamachi" as well&&&&food
cooked in citrus juice&&&&food
she said the dates&&&&food
we ordered the dates and calamari&&&&food+service
the dates were awsome&&&&food
super sweet and wrapped in bacon&&&&food
if you decide to visit caña order those for sure&&&&service
good food, good atmosphere,  and pretty unique drinks&&&&food
Had some time before a movie so we decided to try something other than our usual American fare at Town Square and Cana looked intrigueing&&&&cost
Small plates of food give more chances to taste something different&&&&ambience+food
Hamachi Chicken EmpanadasBeef EmpanadasChicken SkewersPiggy Back DatesCrispy ShrimpFish TacosShort Rib TacosThe Empanadas and Piggy Back Dates were the best things out of the selections&&&&cost+food
A friend recommended this tapas spot and I absolutely enjoyed the apps we got except for one&&&&ambience
We ordered the meatballs, hamachi, beef tenderloin, calamari and they were all great&&&&food+service
We also ordered the Cevichi mushrooms&&&&service
that was the only fail out of the things we ordered cuz it was very citrusy and a bit sour so we had it sent back and the waitress recommended the spicy tuna and it was very good&&&&food+service
Met the General Manager and he hooked it up with their special dessert that evening which was with ice cream, fried bananas and chocolate and like some waffle haha, IT WAS AWESOME&&&&ambience+food+service
It was a bit pricey for the portions that came out&&&&cost+food
its a nice place to take a date out to and the atmosphere was really chill&&&&food
I would highly recommend this place as a date spot&&&&ambience
First, it is dark and you can't tell if it is even still in business when we were walking up&&&&ambience
We ordered a ton of food wanting to try it all&&&&food+service
You could tell they had both been drinking already&&&&food
There were 3 tables in the restaurant and it was freezing in there&&&&ambience
I wore my winter coat through the whole meal and still my teeth were chattering&&&&ambience
The dynamic duo weren't sure if the the Beef Tenderloin Tiradito was available&&&&food
We ordered Ceviche, tuna, dates, sliders, and short ribs, plus the beef tenderloin which we did not know if it was coming or not until it arrived&&&&food+service
BAM, it was all on the table&&&&ambience
I have to say everything was delicious&&&&food
I refused to share the beef tenderloin&&&&food
So, don't overorder&&&&service
The check came and we were surprised at the amount&&&&cost
Finally, we think she said they had changed the Happy Hours and we had missed it by 5 minutes&&&&food
But it is also good customer service to say "sorry you just missed Happy Hour"&&&&food+service
We would have ordered the same anyway&&&&service
It's the point that of all the 1000's of places in Vegas, we went there for food and Happy Hour&&&&food
The service is the lowest&&&&food+service
But the food is really good&&&&food
I hate eating in a winter coat&&&&food
Maybe by summer they will have better service and people watching?---3&&&&food+service
We were passing town through and stopped based on the Yelp reviews&&&&ambience
Others in my group ordered burritos, which were ok&&&&service
I ordered the Mexican salad and asked the waitress to add steak&&&&food+service
It came as a nice mix of greens, covered in warm, melted Kraft cheddar cheese, no steak&&&&ambience+food
The waitress that brought our food was different from the one who took our order, so seemed confused when I pointed out the steak was missing&&&&ambience+food+service
However, she came back promptly with a big plate of steak to add to my salad and said it was ok, because my server had it down right&&&&ambience+food
The blackened chicken quesadilla is amazing&&&&food
While the green salsa was a click too spicy for me, the flavor was unreal&&&&food
my sister did and said the taste was great&&&&food
(It was small, so order a large if you want more) I'm a big guacamole fan and this one again was great&&&&food+service
Still too spicy for me,&&&&food
if you can handle a little heat-you should love it&&&&food
(BTW, I can barely handle any heat at all, so it's probably normal for most people&&&&ambience+food
)I say, grab some friends and try it out&&&&food
Allegedly this place is closed&&&&service
The owners of this place own several places in town, some great and some ok, so they obviously could care less what I had to say&&&&food
It is about the food&&&&food
If you make great food&&&&food
Was the food horrible?  No, the food was not horrible&&&&food
Was the restaurant dirty?  No, the restaurant was actually very clean and nicely decorated&&&&ambience+cost+food
Was the service bad?  No, the service was ok&&&&food+service
why the two stars?  There are countless Mexican establishments in Champaign/Urbana and I've eaten at every one of them&&&&food
I would go eat at any of the good ones before going back here&&&&food
The menu didn't contain 200 items like many of the other establishments, which I found kind of refreshing&&&&ambience+food
However, the prices were crazy high for Mexican food&&&&cost+food
They charge $13&&&&cost
00 more if you want meat such as chicken or steak on it&&&&food
The food was not horrible,&&&&food
The fajitas lacked flavor&&&&food
I had to salt and pepper it to make it taste like something&&&&food
When have you ever had to add salt and pepper to a Mexican dish after it has been served?  If the answer is more than zero&&&&food
you've likely eaten at Cabo's or another bad Mexican restaurant&&&&food
The service consisted of countless college aged students of European decent&&&&food+service
I scanned the staff and didn't see one person that appeared to come from a Mexican background&&&&food+service
This place could be Mexican-American owned and operated,&&&&cost
The employees I encountered were pleasant,&&&&ambience+service
I also believe that my fellow fair skinned man can cook good ethnic food,&&&&ambience+food
With all the other Mexican establishments in town why would I eat here again?  I won't, I'll take my business and money elsewhere where I can get a better meal for less&&&&food
This place is great&&&&food
We ordered the guac, chicken/fish/shrimp tacos, and a chicken crisp and everything was great&&&&food+service
The shrimp tacos were a little spicy,&&&&food
The chicken was my fav&&&&food
Had a tasty drink too&&&&food
I needed a place for an office lunch of about 20 people and decided upon Cabo's&&&&food
John, the general manager, was professional and very friendly upon my initial inquiry and throughout the meal&&&&ambience+service
The service? It could not have been better&&&&food+service
Angela and Joy spoke with me prior to the arrival of the other guests to make sure that everything was set up properly and to make sure that the guests would get the best possible service&&&&food+service
They did a great job of getting drinks and food orders, offering suggestions, and generally having fun with the diners&&&&food+service
Chips and drinks were refilled quickly and all the service was with a smile&&&&food+service
We ordered quite an array of entrees from tacos to fajitas&&&&service
My meal, the stuffed poblano pepper, was excellent&&&&food
Angela suggested adding spicy pork to it,&&&&food
I was determined to have a meat-free meal today&&&&food
I thought the queso we ordered for our chips was outstanding&&&&service
People gobbled up the fresh guacamole, which I personally thought needed just a bit more heat&&&&ambience+food
The other suggestion one person made was that his meal also could have used a bit more heat&&&&food
After lunch, a few of us relaxed at the bar, making for a great ending to a wonderful experience&&&&ambience+food
Great food, great service and reasonable prices&&&&cost+food+service
quite a combination for a Mexican restaurant on the southwest side of Champaign&&&&food
I've only had breakfast here and both times our food was outstanding&&&&food
The eggs were cooked perfectly and the fresh fruit was excellent&&&&ambience+food
The prices are reasonable and a great value IMHO&&&&cost+food
The service was great too -- very friendly staff&&&&food+service
How does this restaurant only have 3 1/2 stars?? I've been here twice and the food was excellent both times&&&&food
The steak enchiladas are fantastic, with high quality meat and fresh sauce&&&&ambience+food
The service is good, with friendly and attentive staff&&&&food+service
Guacamole was dry, we even mixed in salsa&&&&food
Most of the time you find yourself eating your grac, fat b/c it is good&&&&food
Really wanted to like this place, as it's convenient to our home, and I love good Mexican food&&&&food
Salsa seemed canned, not very flavorful&&&&food
Chips thick, obviously brought it&&&&ambience
My husband had the mixed fajitas- amazingly, hardly any flavor&&&&food
It came with no more than a teaspoon of guacamole and pico de gallo&&&&food
Just mashed potatoes in a roasted poblano&&&&ambience+food
Service was okay,&&&&food+service
food was sub-par at best&&&&food
The decor is way better than El Toro or Dos Reales and I don't get the feeling that I might get salmonella at all&&&&ambience
Dos XX Ambar on draftBad Ass Pork TacosChicken EnchiladasDelicious rice with corn in itIt loses one star for just ok service&&&&ambience+food+service
Some confusion with the wait staff and kitchen&&&&service
Good vibe, good food, ok service&&&&food+service
Earlier reviews state that the beans seem to come from a can&&&&food
Overall, great experience and will definitely be trying again to confirm&&&&food
Sadly, Cabo's Cantina is now closed&&&&service
It was great while it lasted&&&&food
The food was very good and we will definitely be back&&&&food
We had cheese curds as an appetizer&&&&food
They were tasty,&&&&food
they are breaded and&&&&food
deep fried and served with a sauce&&&&food
The sauce was a wonderful tomato-jalapeno-fruit sauce (can't fully identify the fruit), and it may have some roasted red pepper&&&&ambience+food
Truly good sauce&&&&food
Too much breading,&&&&food
(We prefer curds warm and "naked" with a spice "rub" rather than a sauce&&&&ambience+food
The pork tacos had ample seasoned pork, cilantro, onions, and (oddly) sour cream&&&&food
But the mix of flavors was very good, and I added the green salsa (that came with the chips) to mine&&&&food
They were spicy and perfectly done&&&&food
Both taco dishes came three to a plate on soft corn tortillas&&&&ambience
The crisp was billed as a Mexican pizza-- a flour tortilla filled with cheese and toppings&&&&cost+food
Not quite a tostada, so Mexican pizza is probably as good a description as any&&&&food
And, most important, it was delicious&&&&food
Especially the hot salsa&&&&ambience+food
It was a tomatillo salsa&&&&ambience
with lots of peppers&&&&food
still not really hot&&&&ambience+food
The red salsa was billed as mild, and it was&&&&cost
None in our party found it exceptional&&&&ambience
The chips were warm and very salty&&&&ambience+food
The menu is relatively large and broad, ranging from tilapia to steak to tacos and burritos&&&&food
And there are many choices in each category&&&&food
Carnivores and vegetarians both will find things on the menu, though vegan vegetarians may not find much&&&&food
The food here is Mexican Inspired&&&&food
It is delicious&&&&food
The steaks and seafood with Mexican spices were amazing, and they have a greater variety of tacos than do the more au&&&&food
The chefs may have worked in a steakhouse as they really know how to cook the steaks&&&&food
And the spices and sauces add to the flavors rather than smothering or overwhelming the meats or vegetables&&&&ambience+food
The place has one other feature that many of our Mexican style restaurants lack&&&&food
a lovely decor&&&&ambience
On the side away from the bar it has normal tables, while the bar area has service at the bar and at those "tall tables" that require high chairs to sit at&&&&ambience+food+service
The decor is simple&&&&ambience
very nice, the music was quite low and we could easily talk over it&&&&ambience+food
There are several TVs and I suspect it serves as a nice sports bar on game days&&&&ambience+food
The wait staff was wonderful&&&&service
Very professional and amazing given that they've only been open for a week&&&&service
Parking is ample and we were seated immediately&&&&food
The waitress took our drink order less than five minutes after we were seated, and the drinks arrived promptly, as did the chips and salsa, and both were refilled quickly and without our needing to ask&&&&food+service
All in all, I think this place is off to a great start in Champaign&&&&food
When I took my first bite of the pork taco, there were so many flavors bursting in my mouth&&&&food
It was spicy and juicy&&&&food
Pork was cooked so perfectly&&&&food
Next, I had the most amazing spinach salad&&&&food
There was a mild curry flavor and the tangerines and onions made it so crisp and fresh&&&&ambience+food
That has been the best salad I have ever had&&&&food
But I have to say, that the winner of it all for me at least is the sauce that came with the cheese curds&&&&food
I am calling it the "Magic Sauce"&&&&food
I hope the owners would start bottling that sauce and having it for sale&&&&cost+food
I even had a fabulous burger that was mildly spiced and had a cumin type flavor to it&&&&food
Great location too&&&&food
I went to Cabo's the first time for dinner because Billy Barooz (same owner,same strip mall) was on a wait list&&&&ambience+cost
had only been open a short time&&&&service
We had tamales, stuffed chili, a burger and pork tacos&&&&food
The tacos are described as spicy, and they were - way hot cayenne&&&&ambience+food
Service was OK, rushed,&&&&ambience+food+service
The second trip was way better, service was friendly, and relaxed&&&&food+service
They were not as crowded&&&&ambience
We had burgers, and steak tacos&&&&food
I had the Black Jack burger with fried jalapeno, cheese, and two beef patties&&&&food
It stood about four inches tall and had a great beef flavor&&&&food
A side order of cheese curds was way overcooked though&&&&food+service
This place will continue to get better as the staff settles in, and the kitchen gets sorted out&&&&service
First let me say that I love Mexican food and really wanted to like this place since it is very close to my office&&&&food
I went there for lunch with some co-workers&&&&service
The man who seated us seemed to be annoyed that we came in&&&&food
The bartender has to come wait on us because the rest of the staff just stood around talking&&&&ambience+food+service
Overall the service wasn't that great&&&&food+service
brought two kinds of salsa that we were told were made "in house so they are extra yummy&&&&ambience+food
"  The salsa had no flavor&&&&food
Everything is one price/one size&&&&cost+food
I ordered the chicken burrito&&&&food+service
My co-worker had ordered the spicy pork burrito, and the third person decided not to eat because she was so put off by the who situation&&&&food+service
They use black beans, which tasted like they were from a can and not washed off&&&&food
They tasted like they had been sitting in some sort of brine solution&&&&food
There was rice, which had no flavor either&&&&food
The rice they serve seemed a bit over cooked, had corn in it, and was very bland&&&&food
Basically they take a couple tortillas, spread some cheese on it,&&&&food
rice, beans lettuce and the chicken&&&&food
The lettuce was wilted and soggy&&&&food
I cut the whole thing in half to eat the chicken&&&&food
The chicken was salty&&&&food
VERY SALTY&&&&food
it smelled so incredibly bad that I just threw the whole thing out at home&&&&ambience
Wasn't too busy and we were quickly seated&&&&food
The waitress brought us chips and salsa&&&&ambience
She was very prompt and helpful&&&&service
Throughout our visit she was very quick to refill our drinks&&&&ambience+food
(My personal favorite) It seemed like the food took a bit longer than we were expecting&&&&food
Once our order arrived, it looked delicious&&&&food+service
As others have mentioned, the black beans have an off taste&&&&food
The rice is pretty bland and underwhelming&&&&food
Both the rice and beans were cold&&&&ambience+food
The chimichanga is filled mostly with rice and beans which didn't help&&&&food
Although the food wasn't the greatest, you do get large portions&&&&food
The food just wasn't that good&&&&food
Champaign is full of middling&&&&food
not terrible places for Mexican food&&&&food
You get your food in seconds,&&&&food
it's pretty much just the same ingredients shuffled around in different combinations, and each component is not all that great&&&&food
I think this is the first truly great place for Mexican I've eaten at in Champaign, which is why I'm throwing caution to the wind and actually giving it a full five stars&&&&food
I've always found the wait staff to be really pleasant&&&&service
I've never had a terrible wait and usually get seated right away&&&&food
It might help that I tend to eat dinner a little earlier, if possible&&&&food
You get chips and salsa, of course, to start at no charge&&&&cost
Their chips were fresh and light and warm&&&&ambience+food
it could have used more lime, and I prefer my guac a bit chunkier&&&&food
Possibly the best thing on their menu are their crisps, which are like little mini-pizzas on a tortilla-based "crust&&&&food
Delicate and flaky and crispy, which you'd hope based on the name&&&&ambience+food
I've had bites of two different crisps-the pork and the red pepper varieties&&&&food
I preferred the pork overall,&&&&food
both were full of flavor&&&&food
Their cheese and sauces seem of a very good quality and are very flavorful&&&&food
I've also tried their pork tacos&&&&food
The tortillas uses for their tacos (white corn, I believe) are great&&&&food
Soft, with a little bit of texture and tooth to them&&&&food
I did think their pork could used a tad more heat,&&&&food
Desert-wise, you must try their fried ice-cream&&&&food
It has a sweet, flaky crust and delicious chocolate drizzle&&&&food
It might be nice if you got two coated, smaller scoops of ice cream instead of one larger one, just to balance out the crust and ice cream proportions a bit better&&&&food
Still, it's delicious&&&&food
As far as drinks go, I have had two of their Margaritas&&&&food
The other was a pineapple and coconut Margarita&&&&food
This had a great taste, though I didn't get much coconut from it other than the toasted coconut on the rim of the glass&&&&ambience+food
HOLF SH*T SALTY&&&&food
I mean SALTY&&&&food+service
Like hey, want some food as a side to your jug of morton's salt with that? Now, I am not one of those people on a low sodium diet, where you body goes into shock consuming salt&&&&food
The guacamole was salty&&&&food
Black beans couldn't even taste beans because it was sooo salty&&&&food
Rice was mushy and had no flavor at all&&&&food
I tried my husband's chicken burrito, and it was salt with chicken essence&&&&food
We wouldn't even bag it up for our dogs to eat&&&&food
I had the cheese enchiladas&&&&food
It was like a really bad quesadilla with some red sauce on it&&&&food
No use of Mexican cheeses-- just really shitty kraft cheese that my knife wouldn't even cut through&&&&ambience+food
Had to ask the bartenders for menus as no one was coming to our table&&&&ambience+food
When she saw that I only ate a bite of my food, she didn't ask if there was anything wrong or how she could fix it&&&&food
I had the blackberry margarita, which tasted of only blackberry syrup&&&&food
Needed to be cut with fresh lime juice&&&&ambience+food
We left with both of us wanting to throw up and head to the sauna to sweat out the salt&&&&food
Seriously eating bad Chinese food and a bunch of sunflower seeds would still be less salt than this place&&&&food
Basically if you like suburb quality Mexican food that uses frozen and not fresh ingredients come here&&&&ambience+food
Great dining experience with the food and service&&&&food+service
The margaritas are tasty and the veggie burrito, in particular, is fantastic&&&&food
I've tired to go to cabo's twice now&&&&food
once when I thought they had just opened&&&&service
I guess things didn't work out so they were not open? and tonight when they closed at 7 for a Christmas party&&&&ambience+service
thankfully billy barooz's was open&&&&ambience+cost+service
I went there for breakfast this morning and the food was great&&&&food
I had the steak and eggs&&&&food
The service and atmosphere were also good&&&&food+service
Once we ordered&&&&service
we waited what seemed like a very long time to get our food&&&&food
The food was not edible&&&&food
The black beans were chalky and cold and had a funny flavor&&&&ambience+food
They serve the Chimichanga with rice and beans on the outside and on the inside&&&&food
I ordered a chicken Chimichanga&&&&food+service
all that was in it was rice and beans and not very good rice and beans either&&&&food
I ordered a classic margarita and it was good&&&&service
it's about a 4 ounce glass and cost $7&&&&ambience+cost
The inside is really nice (just like Smoke Que and Brew)&&&&food
the service and the food suck&&&&food+service
I was so anxious for this place to open and when it did I was thoroughly impressed&&&&ambience+service
I work and live nearby so having a place to eat good Mexican food is a must&&&&food
The menu is just great&&&&food
Lets talk drinks first&&&&food
I'm definitely a margarita lover so having Cabo's wide selection was awesome&&&&ambience
Instead of regular sour mix they make fresh lime juice and organic agave nectar&&&&ambience+food
The Roasted Blackberry and Basil Margarita by far is delicious&&&&food
This combo goes great together&&&&food
Instead of Triple sec, this one calls for a high quality and tasty ingredient called Grand Marnier--it makes the flavor so much better&&&&food
The stuffed poblano is really what hits the spot for me,&&&&ambience
Everyone is so nice, food is great, and the drinks are awesome&&&&ambience+food
I really can't wait for warm weather so the patio is open&&&&ambience+food+service
Best  pizza crust in Vegas&&&&food
The service was fast, friendly and orderly&&&&food+service
Ordered the Canadian bacon with pineapple toppings, just as great as every time I've eaten&&&&food+service
Also ordered the side Caesar salad and Mac and cheese&&&&food+service
recommend for tasty fast food in between the gambling and movies&&&&food
This Sbarro is now CLOSED at the Texas Station Casino&&&&ambience+service
that's too bad because I had a free slice on a coupon and I found it to be quite good&&&&food
Went back today and found it shut down due to Sbarro's bankruptcy&&&&ambience
Ah, Sbarro&&&&ambience
the mainstay of every mall or food court since I can remember&&&&food
With their large pizzas, variety of sides, and large drinks, how can you not like this place?On my last trip here, I came with some friends to get some food in our systems before/during/after beers&&&&food
We all three ordered the meal which consisted of a slice of pizza, a delicious side, and a drink&&&&food+service
In my case, I got a pepperoni pizza, toasted mini potatoes, and a Pepsi&&&&ambience+food
I should mention that they had like 5 different kids of pizza ready to serve up (pepperoni, ham/pineapple, cheese, sausage, jalapeno, stuffed&&&&food
) which they warm up for you really quickly before serving it&&&&ambience
As for the quality of my pizza? It was good&&&&food
The little potatoes they served me were pretty good, too&&&&ambience+food
My friends ordered the pasta on the side, and they were happy with their food selections as well&&&&food+service
As a matter of fact, they were happy enough with their sides that they ate them before the pizza and said it was a 5-star meal, though I was erring on the side of 3&&&&ambience+food
(Thus the four-star rating)Service here is always pretty quick and simple&&&&food+service
Prices are ok (I paid like 7&&&&cost+food
80 for the meal, which is pretty good for the amount of food&&&&cost+food
I stop here after work to pick up food for my grease loving hubby&&&&food
The food is pretty much the same as any other Sbarro&&&&ambience+food
I remember when this place was Farmer Boy back in the late 90s&&&&food
Always big portions of good food, friendly service, and open 24/7&&&&food+service
It has gone through a few name changes since&&&&ambience
My really good experiences here have outweighed the not so great experiences&&&&food
I consider it a "locals" spot, so it's not five star dining by any stretch&&&&ambience
But the portions are still good-sized, and there are generally daily specials for a good price&&&&cost+food
I miss the old Farmer Boy restaurant,&&&&food
I think Luna's is still a good option to consider if you're looking for a good meal for a reasonable price&&&&cost+food
Worse than a grade school cafeteria canned food&&&&food
Only bright spot&&&&ambience
Coffee smelled burnt&&&&ambience+food
had no taste&&&&food
Asked non coffee drinking husband to try and he agreed&&&&food
No matter the coupon&&&&ambience
not worth the meal&&&&cost
My wife and I both ordered the rib eye steak dinner for $10&&&&food+service
It came with a choice of soup or salad (we chose the salad with a delicious Greek house dressing), giant baked potato and mixed vegetables (out of a can), and free dessert (choice of ice cream or rice pudding - we chose rice pudding and brought it home&&&&ambience+food
The steaks were slightly over-cooked and not great,&&&&ambience+food
not bad, smothered in onions and mushrooms (out of a can)&&&&food
The baked potatoes were the highlight of the meal&&&&ambience+food
Good service (she forgot the dinners rolls,&&&&food+service
Food is bland&&&&food
Reminds me of hospital food&&&&food
chicken soup was a big bowl&&&&ambience+food
truly had only one small cube of chicken in it&&&&food
Vegetables have been reheated multiple times resulting in the peas being hard as rocks&&&&ambience+food
Mashed potatoes were "instant&&&&ambience+food
"  Coffee is good&&&&food
Waitress was nice and kept refilling my coffee&&&&food
This place was fine for breakfast, the greek scramble was tasty and hearty&&&&food
Nice owners, very fast (even curt) servers&&&&food
overall friendly enough&&&&service
Decor is about three decades out of date though&&&&ambience
The last 2 times the food has been bad&&&&food
The main reason we won't go back, the last time we were in our waitress went to the wrong table, realized it&&&&ambience
Poor service and lousy food&&&&food+service
Great prices though&&&&cost+food
I'm not considering this a full review, since we just stopped in here for dessert and coffee&&&&food
3 of us ordered desserts (2 slices of cake, one of the apple pie)&&&&food+service
Received ginormous portions (especially of the cake, 3 of us could split one slice of that)&&&&food
Everything was tasty,&&&&food
This area doesn't have many options if you've got the taste for dessert (other than ice cream) and don't want to whip up some brownies&&&&food
Food I saw on other tables all looked pretty good&&&&ambience+food
Spotless bathroom&&&&ambience
I think the Corned Beef Hash is calling out to me&&&&food
Don't usually come here for the same reasons mentioned in other reviews about service, cleanliness, etc&&&&ambience+food+service
Again, got the same put out attitude from the servers and slimy table top near the kitchen&&&&ambience+food
The big thing that got me this time was as the wife and I sat there waiting for our food, one of the bus boys who was apparently on his break and looked to be one of the owners relatives, reached over our table to grab some ketchup to put on HIS plate of eggs&&&&ambience+food
He was in clear view and in the way of the service traffic&&&&ambience+food+service
Good thing we don't use ketchup on our eggs&&&&food
The funniest thing was after we got our food the the tide of people that came in behind us must have overwhelmed them&&&&food
The staff looked horrified like they didn't expect this much overflow on Mother's Day or capable of handling it&&&&service
Only got one refill of coffee in this panicked frenzy of pisses off staff and patrons&&&&food+service
Must have the Luna's Corned Beef sandwich&&&&food
My husband and I were out for a Sunday drive when we spotted this restaurant and decided to stop for dinner&&&&ambience
After a quick visit to the clean restroom, we were greeted and seated immediately&&&&ambience+food
Three menus appeared&&&&food
Our waitress could not have been more helpful&&&&service
On her recommendation, we both chose the fried chicken dinner&&&&food
It was crunchy, slightly sweet, and oh so good&&&&ambience+food
It came with potato, rolls, corn, and either soup or salad&&&&ambience+food
I had the Italian wedding soup which was delicious&&&&food
Not heavy on celery taste, although clearly there was celery added&&&&ambience+food
Dinner comes with a scoop of ice cream for dessert, if you like&&&&food
Our waitress was so attentive, never missing a beat&&&&food
Food is so good with big portions you can never go wrong with that&&&&food
Food is terrible&&&&food
The food literally had no taste, the service was slow&&&&food+service
I won't go back there if you paid me&&&&cost
I would rather step in front of a bus than eat at this sh@thole again&&&&food
Found Luna's through Yelp and glad we did&&&&ambience
Great service and quality food at low prices&&&&cost+food+service
Hubs ordered biscuits and gravy with eggs which he scarfed down&&&&food+service
I had a denver omlette bagel sandwich which was delicious&&&&food
I had the chicken noodle soup which was the strangest tasting I've ever had&&&&food
The fish fry was extremely greasy as well&&&&ambience+food
The staff wasn't very friendly and as I was leaving I noticed that all of the bakery in the display case was purchased from WalMart&&&&food+service
Terrible customer service today&&&&food+service
We're used to waiting for a table&&&&ambience
5 people in their party and they went out of their way to push tables together and say them before us&&&&ambience
First visit, owner could not have been friendlier, server was attentive & friendly, my AYCE cod dinner came with delicious lentil soup & canned or frozen corn, french fries were good, wife's sandwich was decent if not memorable, kitchen did a good job in getting orders out, restrooms were clean, dining area was orderly&&&&ambience+food+service
But the second trip -- had the fried cod dinner again, and there was something N-O-T Q-U-I-T-E R-I-G-H-T about it, tartar sauce wasn't even fully mixed, in place of the corn I had mixed (ugh&&&&food
) veggies, french fries almost soggy, rice pudding had a liberal dose of cinnamon&&&&food
it was still thin and tasteless, owner too busy on a personal phone call to say hello&&&&food
The good news -- our server was excellent, the kitchen got orders out quickly again, the rest rooms still clean, the dining room still neat and orderly&&&&ambience+food+service
the lentil soup was still quite good&&&&food
their breakfast menu looks good, with eggs, omelettes, waffles, skillets, etc&&&&food
After reviewing the menu I decided to try something 'safe' so I ordered the meat loaf with mashed potatoes and gravy&&&&ambience+food+service
The meat loaf had very little seasoning, if any&&&&food
It had an odd taste&&&&food
It also appeared to be overcooked around the edges&&&&food
The 'mashed' potatoes were quite lumpy&&&&ambience+food
It appeared they had been mashed quickly, possibly just before they were served&&&&food
And when I tried to pay my check, there was no one at the register&&&&cost
I probably stood there about 3 minutes before another customer got in line behind me&&&&food
She finally summoned a waiter and asked if we could pay our bills&&&&cost+service
disappeared for a moment and&&&&food
returned and said "She will be with you in a minute&&&&food
"   Not good customer service&&&&food+service
While the price was reasonable, the food didn't live up to the hype that I received&&&&cost+food
There are better places with food that is more appetizing&&&&food
went for breakfast & ordered waffles, they were horrible&&&&service
not sure how a restaurant could mess up waffles so badly, such a basic food to prepare&&&&food
It's the local breakfast place, not a chain with fancy meals and prices---4&&&&cost+food
Horrific food, horrific service&&&&food+service
We had a frozen burger and a wilted salad of iceburg lettuce that was way over seasoned&&&&food
The waitress brought the check before the food and didn't check on us again&&&&ambience+food
Obviously prepared food with shortcuts&&&&food
I walked in and first of all it smelled like mold and i smelled the bathrooms from the front door&&&&ambience
The wait was short, however, the server almost didn't notice that I was there&&&&food
it seemed like there was no host to seat me&&&&food
The server asked politely, if i would like a table or booth&&&&ambience+service
I was seated and the server, asked, what can i get you to drink&&&&food
I ordered my drink and the server left&&&&food+service
As I am drinking my pop, the server finally brings me the menu and leaves again&&&&food
As I am looking at the menu I noticed there were family members of the owner/manager (maybe), helping out in which I thought was cute? But kind of weird&&&&food+service
I thought that it was sweet that a family business was helped by togetherness of family members&&&&food
As I am waiting for the server to return  to take my order I noticed that some of the tables were dirty and the floor was sticky&&&&ambience+food+service
It seemed  that the tables were not properly wiped off&&&&ambience
The server finally came back to take my order, i ordered the corn beef and fries instead of cabbage  and a salad with oil and vinegar&&&&food+service
I sat and waited for my order for about 15-20 minutes&&&&food+service
The owner/manager was walking around helping out his family members&&&&service
That's a good owner/manager helping out&&&&service
The server brought out the salad with the dressings&&&&ambience+food
I notice that the dressing  bottle was very dirty, The rest of the food came out all at once instead of the appetizer first&&&&ambience+food
The hummus did not taste like hummus&&&&food
The hummus was very tasteless&&&&food
The corn beef was bland and the carrots tasted like  they came from a can from the store&&&&food
The fries tasted as if they were prefrozened  and prepared from a bag instead of fresh&&&&ambience+food
After looking at the dessert i remember seeing the brand of cake sold at walmart&&&&food
For some reason, even though there were only a few tables with diners, our waitress seated us right by the kitchen&&&&ambience+food
She kept coming over and rushing us to make a decision&&&&ambience
When I say rushing I mean like every minute or so&&&&ambience+food+service
The Chicken Noodle Soup looked like glorified boxed soup&&&&food
The salad had lettuce that was starting to rust&&&&food
Someone must really like onions because there were 7 large slices of red onion on it&&&&food
But, here is the best part was the dressing came in a squeeze package like the ones at fast food places&&&&food
The meatloaf was horrible&&&&food
strangely the mashed potatoes were good&&&&ambience+food
The fried chicken was OK&&&&food
They make it with honey so chicken is very sweet and not something I'd eat again&&&&food
The fries were typical frozen french fries&&&&food
If the food wasn't disappointing enough, all of the servers had bad attitudes and it showed&&&&food
They don't care about the quality of their food or service&&&&food+service
Inedible slop&&&&food
Under cooked meat, powdered potatoes, gravy and veggies from a can&&&&ambience+food
I didn't even get a doggie bag despite eating only two bites&&&&food
Avoid at all cost&&&&cost
Food is always good service is sometimes iffy,&&&&food+service
They have great sandwiches and soup&&&&food
Gross, dirty, poor service, and crappy food to boot&&&&ambience+food+service
The waitress was rude and seem annoyed that I brought children to eat with me&&&&ambience+food+service
The charged me for a glass of water if you can imagine&&&&ambience+cost+food
My sandwich was soggy as were the fries&&&&food
Local restaurant with friendly staff&&&&service
Food is normally served very fast, and its really good&&&&food
Location of the place is very comfortable&&&&ambience
We have been twice and more than happy both times&&&&food
Typical convenient store, with a nice hot kitchen with plenty to choose from&&&&ambience+food
Pizza by the slice, whole pizzas, chicken, subs, etc&&&&food
we each had the Italian sub (hot) and split an order of chicken tenders & jojos&&&&ambience+food+service
The Italian subs were great&&&&food
Good size, ok flavor&&&&food
The tenders left much to be desired&&&&food
, big enough and with great flavor&&&&food
the wings were delicious&&&&food
Much more flavor&&&&food
the tenders&&&&food
On our next trip, we'll go for a mixed bucket of chicken for sure&&&&food
Good pizza whether you order or are on the go&&&&food+service
You can't beat the 4&&&&food
Great subs, hot or cold&&&&ambience+food
A convenient store with a good hot kitchen&&&&ambience+food
You can either order a pizza or sub or you can take advantage of their hot and ready pizza by the slice&&&&ambience+food+service
There is a sign on the deli cooler that says if you spend $20 in groceries you get a free pizza&&&&food
I have been going here for years and there have been a lot of different employees over the last 10 years&&&&service
The staff is always very friendly&&&&service
I do highly recommend this place for the pizza by the slice if you aren't too uppity to visit a store in a low income area&&&&food
So stop by and grab a few slices of pizza and don't forget to get a Cold Classic Glass Bottled Coke to go with it&&&&ambience+food
Chapman's is a nice little convenience store in a neighborhood across from a boarded up house in Lorain&&&&ambience+food
The two people I've encountered working there are the friendliest people you'll meet&&&&ambience
They make a great team&&&&food
The kitchen serves up hot, made to order pizzas (also available by the slice), subs, fried chicken, and jojos at very reasonable prices&&&&ambience+cost+food+service
Fellow Yelper, Darren R has been raving about the delicious Fiery Gauntlet sub for a while and he has reason to because that sammich and the Italian sub I've tried have been really tasty&&&&food
They come loaded with savory deli meat and cheese sliced fresh in house with fresh, crisp lettuce, tomato, and onion finished with a smidgen of creamy Italian dressing, nicely toasted on a seasoned hoagie roll&&&&ambience+food
I've had the pizza by the slice and it's pretty good at $1&&&&food
69 for one slice or $2&&&&food
99 for two slices&&&&food
You can order a whole pizza any way you'd like it too&&&&food+service
The fried chicken looked really fresh and juicy also&&&&ambience+food
Maybe I'll give they a try next time after I'm off my clean eating kick&&&&ambience+food
This last visit was a cheat meal, I swear&&&&food
Prices arereasonable&&&&cost+food
Home cooked style meals&&&&food
We ordered an entree of steak, calamari,and grilled cod&&&&food+service
There are several sides to order from&&&&service
Prices were reasonable&&&&cost+food
Rhum Corner was closed so we walked on and found this place&&&&service
We ordered the fish cakes and shrimp patties- for starters&&&&food+service
They were fresh and delicious&&&&ambience+food
Piping hot, I tell ya&&&&ambience+food
We were stuffed before our quarter chicken dinners came&&&&food
But when they arrived, hot with fresh veggies and rice&&&&ambience+food
not to forget the grilled chicken, our greedy sides kicked in and we dug in&&&&food
It truly is very very good food&&&&food
I felt like I had a really good home cooked meal&&&&food
it sounded kinda like "Carniceria," which always means good food&&&&ambience+food+service
Boisterous olive skinned people (the Portugese?) conversed loudly with each other across piles of chicken and glasses of red wine&&&&ambience+food
About the time when I was starting to feel out of place, this sweet girl behind the counter grabbed my attention and set me at ease with a good old "hi there, let me know if you have any questions&&&&ambience+food
" I ended up ordering the half chicken special, the words leaving my mouth slow and gummy due to the fact that my lips were still frozen&&&&food+service
Within two minutes of stepping into this place I felt like I had been dropped into another country and I was gonna need a friend&&&&food
Initially, I had planned to grab the food and go,&&&&food
the ambience was so pleasant that I decided to stay, even if that meant eating dinner in a restaurant by myself while being scrutinized by locals&&&&ambience+food+service
I pulled out this new neuroscience book that I'd been hoping to read and got to work on it&&&&ambience
waitress girl brought out some bread and&&&&ambience+food
Before I knew it, the chicken dinner arrived&&&&food
The thing was huge, one of those classic big Italian dinner plates piled high with salad, spherical potatoes, chicken, and dipping sauce&&&&ambience+food
It was truly the biggest pile of food I'd ever seen at a restaurant in Toronto&&&&food
The chicken was fantastic&&&&food
Rubbed with salt and some interesting combination of spices&&&&food
It was totally worth breaking this week-long vegetarian streak I'd been on&&&&cost+food
The potatos, too, were remarkable&&&&ambience+food
salty, roasty, and inherently satisfying&&&&food
However, the best part of the dish was the piri piri sauce&&&&food
This stuff (which waitress girl later informed me was handmade made in house), had the perfect balance of heat, acidity, and flavor&&&&food
It also had a fair bit of creaminess that really rounded out the flavor of the potatoes&&&&ambience+food
All too soon, the chicken was gone and I was stuffed&&&&food
Not even the thought of having to bike through the snow could put a damper on my chicken-fortified spirit&&&&ambience+food
I'd had a good meal, made some progress on this book, and found a cool new place to eat where I felt welcome&&&&ambience+food+service
Tasty and good value?  Definitely&&&&food
Decor is minimal with a TV&&&&ambience
The FOOD was all decent with some hits and misses&&&&food
The grouper was quite tasty, although we weren't sure that it was actually grouper&&&&food
The half chicken was probably the best dish of the night and came with a delightfully spicy dipping sauce&&&&ambience+food
The steak, which I ordered medium rare,  was served on the well done side of well done&&&&food+service
however, the flavor was actually good&&&&food
I don't get why places ask about steak temperatures if it's not going to make a difference anyway&&&&food
Fries were pretty limp&&&&food
SERVICE was friendly and very casual&&&&food+service
Definitely not a place to come if you're in a rush&&&&ambience
The food took a long time to come out,&&&&food
the free bread and olives helped with the wait&&&&food
Drinks are fairly reasonable as well&&&&ambience+food
It doesn't quite rate as a hidden gem,&&&&cost
Das Steak war sehr lecker,auch die Beilagen&&&&food
Der Service war auch sehr nett&&&&food+service
Wir waren rundum zufrieden&&&&food
Wurden durch einen Aktions-Flyer auf das Steakrestaurant Montero in Stuttgart Schönberg aufmerksam&&&&food
Hatten einen tollen Abend freundliches Personal , stimmiges Ambiente , frisches argentinisches Rindfleisch auf den Punkt gegrillt&&&&ambience
Kleines Minus man sollte immer Bargeld dabei haben,leider Kreditzahlung nicht möglich aber dafür haben die Preise ein dickes Plus verdient&&&&ambience
Das Huftsteak war sehr gut und perfekt gegrillt (Metro-Ware)&&&&food
Freundlicher Service - nicht immer der Schnellste, aber sehr zuvorkommend&&&&food+service
Das Steakhouse gibt es seit 2009 dort und wir kommen sicher wieder&&&&food
Zum Essen gabe es ein argentinisches Steak mit Salatbüffet und Beilage&&&&food
Das Essen war echt super und das Steak war so wie es sein muss&&&&food
I've had a tough time finding steak around this area that compares with what I'm used to having back home&&&&food
When I'm looking to go out for steak, I'll be going here from now on&&&&food

My friend says their pancakes are the best she's ever had&&&&food
I've never had them as I'm not much of a pancake eater,&&&&food
As for cleanliness - I've definitely eaten in cleaner joints&&&&ambience+food
The reason John's gets 4 and not 3, is they have what I call a great 'diner waitress'&&&&food

She calls you 'hun' or 'sweetie'&&&&food

Too many restaurants slink around your ankles like beaten dogs, cravenly asking, "Do you want anything, sir?  Please?  Yes, I can get it for you, restaurant-Gollum loves the master, we adoreses you&&&&food
They treat you like people&&&&food
The waitresses tell you what's going on in the back, complain merrily about the job, bring your food to you, pat you on the shoulders&&&&food
They have that quiet pride that says, "If you behave well, you're part of the family here&&&&ambience
one suspects that if I asked them for, say, a pomegranate-infused soda, they'd look at me sternly and go, "Now, what did you want THAT for?"As such, it's supremely pleasant atmosphere&&&&food
This is a classic DINER diner, a long narrow train tube with a row of stools for the quick eaters and beat-up booths in the back, where the scents waft out of the kitchen behind the counter&&&&ambience+food
The food?  Well, as Gini notes, they put the greasy in greasy spoon,&&&&ambience+food

They have all the greatest diner hits, from eggs and bacon to open-faced turkey sandwich, and the food is not exceptional&&&&food+service
it is home-made and fills you up quite nicely on a low budget&&&&food

John's has the most delish corned beef hash in town&&&&food
Yeah, the coffee mugs have lipstick stains and the forks aren't the cleanest,&&&&ambience+food
places like these are called "greasy spoons" for a reason&&&&ambience
In the words of Bart Simpson, "This ain't the Ritz&&&&ambience
"Their staff is super friendly&&&&service
You never need to ask for coffee refills&&&&food
And they have the best, most yummy coffee creamer&&&&food
Not hazelnut, Carmel macchiato or anything frou frou&&&&food
Just a very enjoyable cup 'o joe&&&&ambience
To preface this, I'm under the impression that things were going through a change on this first and last visit here&&&&ambience
The establishment was dirty&&&&ambience
Let's order&&&&service
So the child of our bunch ordered the spaghetti and meatballs, the adults meals were roast beef and mashed potatoes and gravy as well as swedish meatballs over noodles&&&&ambience+food+service
Each meal came with the soup of the day (a creamy spinach soup with whatever those noodles are in wedding soup)&&&&food
I ordered the chili on top of that just to have a taste&&&&food+service
Not like a gross like this is too sweet, or too salty, or just not a good recipe&&&&food
it was GROSS in a way that can only be described as it seemed as though it was so old and re-used or SOMETHING that it developed a taste of nothing with the consistency of cream of wheat&&&&food
The soup of the day came out&&&&food
Gross for the same reasons except this also had the added pleasure of tasting like they "of the dayified" the soup pot by adding a block of salt&&&&ambience+food
I eat EVERYTHING no matter what&&&&ambience+food
I dd NOT eat this&&&&food
The roast beef and mashed potatoes come out&&&&ambience+food
Immediately I see those scooped, starchy, obviously flake potatoes&&&&ambience+food
Not my cup of tea&&&&ambience+food
The roast beef, however, looked (and I tasted it) and tasted HORRIBLE&&&&food
It had a gray tinge to it, had the appearance of a texture closer to pencil shavings (only larger) and there was literally zero moisture left in it at all&&&&ambience+food
While that was going on, I heard the waitress speak to the "chef" and explained that the Swedish Meatballs over noodles uses egg noodles and not spaghetti noodles and moreover (she didn't use that word I assure you) the "sauce" is a brown gravy and not marinara sauce&&&&food
The "chef" tried to give me the exact same thing the child across from me had and call it "Swedish Meatballs Over Noodles"&&&&food
So, after a brief lapse, the plate comes out&&&&ambience
unbeknownst to me half my plate had spilled onto the counter during transport and the waitress had used a couple spools to get it back onto my plate before giving it to me&&&&ambience
It's the same meatballs sitting across from me, the same spaghetti noodles (not egg noodles) sitting across from me with the same brown gravy sitting across from me&&&&food
I sliced into the first meatball&&&&food
It was nearly frozen in the center had a salty briny taste from the gravy that also seemed spoiled&&&&food
The very first time in my years I just pushed a plate away and refused to eat it&&&&ambience+food
I let her know that I will kindly pay for these meals&&&&cost
I wasn't about to debate what should be taken off, get into a mathematics quiz with someone who seems confused that she is even working at a restaurant (again, no offense&&&&ambience
So I was charged a little over 20 bucks&&&&cost
She could figure out how to open the drawer or use it in any way&&&&food+service
She talked to it in disdain and was even starting to have that same kind of demeanor Kathy Bates had in Misery&&&&service
you aren't quite sure what that means&&&&service
John's Diner is your typical family diner,  that is inexpensive with good tasting food&&&&food
Also, I would much rather support an affordable, good quality locally owned and run  'mom and pop' restaurant, instead of those overrated and rapaciously expensive national chains&&&&cost+food
I love breakfast food&&&&food
In spite of John's Diner having all of these ingredients, it proved to be the perfect storm for one of the most uncomfortable experiences of my dining life&&&&ambience
It was filthy (I got a coffee mug with hot-pink lipstick caked on it), outdated, muggy, falling apart, the coffee was weak and the food was cheap - in quality and price&&&&ambience+cost+food
Save yourself the discomfort and visit the real no-frills diners of lakewood&&&&ambience
The Place to Be and The Coffee Pot&&&&ambience+food
You say greasy?  Then you never ate Southern food which is simple boiled or baked anything loaded with grease and/or sugar and/or salt&&&&ambience+food
and does now like Cleveland diner food my dad ate when he worked for the railroad&&&&food
Western sandwiches, hot roast pork on white bread with mashed potatoes and gravy, lemon meringue pie and sausage with eggs and home fries&&&&ambience+food
The fish fry every Fridays beats any I have had to line up for in a church basement during lent&&&&food
Thanks to whoever is keeping John's going with the same food and the simple interior and the same diner prices&&&&cost+food
We heard the cook complaining about how he was tired of serving terrible food&&&&food
We had chicken noodle soup with no chicken in it&&&&food
Food was nearly inedible&&&&food
Piles of food flying off the grill straight to the hungry locals&&&&food
Hungry? Try the corn beef hash, this mountain of tender beef and potatoes, topped off with a crown of eggs, will fill you up for cheap&&&&ambience+cost+food
Coffee is hot, service is ornery, food is awesome&&&&ambience+food+service
One star off for the facilities, they are definitely showing the age, and it bugged me a bit that the air vents were "fuzzy"&&&&ambience
" We took a seat at the only available spot on the bar&&&&ambience+food
The employee dynamic was miserable at best&&&&service
The younger of the three women was yelling into the kitchen "I'm not going to serve fatty bacon&&&&food
" I left before they even had a chance to take my order (which was easily 10 minutes after I sat down)&&&&food+service
Breakfast wasn't too good here , bacon kinda in edible ,&&&&food
the people working were really nice , my bf loved his omelette&&&&food
( my potatoe hash was so oily I mean like pizza oily&&&&ambience+food+service
due to the  cash only policy, we forget about the place often , which is a shame&&&&food

Coffee was awesome and before I could even think about getting another cup, I noticed it was already full&&&&ambience+food
They must have charged us for EVERY refill, including coffee&&&&cost+food

You get what you pay for in this case,&&&&cost
DO NOT order dinner food, it will be gross&&&&food+service
Their home fries are heavenly&&&&food
This was the absolute most disgusting food i ever attempted to eat in my life&&&&food
I would not feed this food to my dog or a stray one on the verge of death for that matter&&&&ambience+food
The coffee was cold, the water had a stench and an after taste, the soup was cold&&&&ambience+food
The food was rotten&&&&food
The steak which i didnt expect to be the greatest smelled rotten and tastes sour, the gravy was old lumpy and foul&&&&ambience+food
I have never once went to an establishment order 4 different menu items and everyone take 2 bites get sick to their stomach and not eat&&&&food+service
The fact that the waitress took 4 plates not even touched filled with food back and not question was beyond me&&&&ambience+food
I would rather eat the scraps thrown into a dumpster  from a gas station&&&&food
& it smells horrible---1&&&&ambience
The only reason I did not give this place a single star is because I appreciate its history in the area and building itself is like eating in a time machine&&&&food
However, the food here is just not good&&&&food
and yes I have only ordered breakfast&&&&service
My eggs were undercooked as was my bacon&&&&food
Additionally, my coffee cup had lipstick stains on it&&&&ambience+food

this kashman's is closed - as of Sunday June 20, 2010Their summit location is still OPEN - however, this is a little farewell to the Pinnacle Peak location&&&&cost+service
really - they did everything to drive my business away, so when I say their doors closed, I was actually relieved because they left a sour taste in my mouth&&&&food+service
While their food was decent, it was overpriced and I never got over just how cold and unwelcoming they were to not just me&&&&ambience+cost+food+service
Kashman's is the go-to deli of choice for my family&&&&food
omelets, oatmeal, bagels, sandwiches, salads, etc&&&&food
it's all delicious&&&&food
Their chicken noodle soup combined with a power bagel and cream cheese does the job&&&&food
There is something about the combination of carbs, fluid, protein, and dairy&&&&ambience+food
I am a regular customer at Kashman's and although I feel like it's kind of expensive, I love their food, so it's worth it to me&&&&cost+food
Today I had the chopped farmers salad (no cheese + turkey)&&&&food
I love that it is full with veggies and the light balsamic dressing they use goes perfectly with it&&&&ambience+food
Other menu items that I order consistently are the omelettes (they do egg whites no problem), oatmeal, trifecta plate, turkey sandwich, and tuna melt&&&&ambience+food+service
The bagels are the best I've had in Arizona, and my friend DeDe swears by their matzah ball soup&&&&ambience+food
a guy had bought lunch for his wife and came up to the register when I was paying and said&&&&cost
1 - I'm glad they will not reserve food like that&&&&food
I have been and will continue to be a loyal Kashman's customer&&&&service
Kashman's has great food&&&&food
you really have to gear yourself up for the rude owner (artichoke lady) and some of the mean, crotchety ladies that work behind the counter&&&&ambience+service
This is not a good place to place your order by phone&&&&service
when you pick your order up, they get all bent out of shape because you have no place to stand and wait for your order&&&&service
The guys and gals that bus are usually super efficient and very friendly and the food is above average&&&&food+service
If you're looking for good food and a verbal lashing from the staff that work there,&&&&food+service
Kashman's is your place to eat&&&&food
Best breakfast in Scottsdale&&&&food
) After reading some of the reviews, yes - it is a little expensive for breakfast and yes- the food is normal breakfast food,&&&&food
I mostly love it because it is one of the few places that I know that welcomes pets&&&&service
I feel so guilty some mornings getting up and leaving my little pooch that it is nice to have a place I can take him&&&&food
Of course there is outdoor seating and it is a great way to start out your day&&&&food
I love all Jewish delis, especially ones located 30 seconds from my office door&&&&food
Once you figure out how this place works, it is a great place for a casual and tasty breakfast&&&&food
When you arrive, it is important to get a number for an open table before you order&&&&ambience+service
Also, the menu is fairly long, so it is best to get a paper copy and figure out what you want before getting in line&&&&ambience
I say this because even though the line may appear long, it moves FAST&&&&food
Yes, these people at Kashman's are quick and efficient, so you don't want to reach the counter undecided&&&&ambience
All have been great and arrive at the table quickly&&&&ambience+food
An added plus is the fresh-squeezed orange juice&&&&ambience+food
The seating inside can be tight, especially if there are peole waiting in line to order,&&&&food+service
there is ample seating outside, most of which is either in the shade or under umbrellas&&&&food
One thing I really enjoy is that it is a dog-friendly place - they have bowls of ice water and bags of biscuits outside for our furry friends to enjoy&&&&ambience+food+service
Have it on a cinnamon raisin bagel, I know it sounds nasty&&&&ambience+food
it's delicious&&&&food
Kashma's service is great and well worth the trip&&&&cost+food+service
I've only been for breakfast, so I can only attest to the deliciousness of their eggs and potatoes&&&&ambience+food
They really make magic with their eggs here&&&&food
You also get a choice of bread with your breakfast, and I always get a bagel&&&&food
Oh and you can exchange your potatoes for fruit if you want to&&&&ambience+food
The staff is a little brash though&&&&service
I just get my plate of tasty food, pay just a little (Kashman's is pretty cheap) and grab a table&&&&ambience+cost+food
you'll be surrounded by dogs because Kashman's is definitely four-legged-friend-friendly&&&&food+service
Was visiting Scottsdale this weekend and wanted a local place for breakfast&&&&food
The food was pretty good&&&&food
the service kind of sucked&&&&food+service
The woman taking the order in the restaurant came off as rude and not friendly at all&&&&service
Pretty good food for a reasonable price&&&&cost+food
Great selection of hot and cold sandwiches, scrambles, salads, and real bagels&&&&ambience+food
the Trifecta Salad Sampler, with a scoop of tuna salad, to die for egg salad, and chicken salad on a bed of romaine, with freshly sliced cucumber, avocado and tomato&&&&ambience+food
Get in line, order, grab a table and enjoy the hustle and bustle atmosphere&&&&ambience+food+service
I love breakfast, and this place has decent food&&&&food
BUT it is just very VERY normal food&&&&food
Nothing unique or special and It is WAY overpriced&&&&cost+food
I don't like to wait 40 minutes for some average waffles&&&&food
I swear that they have some of the best bagels that I've had in the valley- their jalapeno bagel hits the spot&&&&ambience
I was also a big fan of and can recommend the Thanksgiving Cranberry Turkey and Sonoran Chicken sandwiches&&&&food
It's only two strip malls away from my parents' hood (since I'm a visitor and didn't keep track of actual distances, and there are strip malls galore in this area, that's how I keep tabs on locations), and it's a Jewish-sounding deli&&&&ambience
My cousin, a 19-year-old macho man terrorizing much of the Phoenix female population currently, got the chicken salad sandwich&&&&food
It was piled high with mayonnaisy (how in the heck should I spell that, sorry) looking chopped chicken&&&&food
My boyfriend got the roast beef sandwich with cheese and roasted red peppers&&&&food
picked off the red peppers&&&&food
I tried one, and could see why they wouldn't really fit with the rest -- really pungent tasting, would totally overwhelm and stand out from the other flavors&&&&food
I got the half sandwich/half salad combo with the thanksgiving turkey sandwich (cranberry spread, yum) on whole wheat, house salad&&&&food
This rates ok since it's convenient and serviceable,&&&&cost+food+service
really it's not the good Jewish deli I was hoping for, and the prices are pretty high for just a sandwich&&&&cost+food
I'd rather pick up fixings and make my own at this cost, which is what I did the next day&&&&cost
Pinnacle Peak location now closed, just fyi&&&&service
Food was good&&&&food
I felt it to be a little over priced for a place that does not serve you&&&&cost+food
In my opinion, I found Kashman's to be very overpriced for breakfast, and I found it to be the same quality as The Good Egg&&&&cost+food
way to over priced&&&&cost+food
Pros = Above average deli food, pet friendly, fills the need for Jewish food in this part of the Valley&&&&food+service
Cons = Overpriced, too-hot coffee, slow service at times&&&&ambience+cost+food+service
Somewhat strangely, Kashman's has 2 locations off Scottsdale road within about 2 miles of each other&&&&food
This would make sense if the food was stellar and the prices were reasonable,&&&&cost+food
Kashman's is North Scottsdale's best-kept open secret, something that many people living in the depths of Central Phoenix have never heard of and would never deign schlepping to for breakfast&&&&food+service
We became intimately familiar with it when we lived for nearly a year up in a  Grayhawk apartment, waiting for our condo renovation to be completed&&&&ambience+service
I love the egg dishes (try the Chicago omelet), the salads (Trifecta rocks), pastries made in-store (the black-and-whites are good, and the fat-free blueberry muffins are better than the regular ones--all are usually refrigerated, though, so you may want to ask for your muffin to be heated before serving) and the bagels have the perfect bite and chewiness (contrast with the bagel-shaped bread that Einstein's churns out)&&&&cost+food
Unlike some of the other reviewers, I have found the owner's family to be quite friendly and quick to recognize regulars&&&&service
Seating is sketchy during peak hours, although, for a relatively small strip-center establishment, there are a decent number of tables in and outside&&&&ambience+food
As a first-timer, remember to ask the wait staff at the door to give you a number corresponding with an open table&&&&ambience+service
You will need this when placing your order at the counter&&&&ambience+service
It can be difficult to peruse the large menu, so it may help to grab a paper copy before queuing up&&&&food
instead it's an order at the counter and the food is brought out kind of place&&&&ambience+food+service
There was a TON of seating outside, and I remarked to my wife that Kashman's is probably the place to go on the weekend's once the temps cool down&&&&food
We each ordered a coffee and the wife ordered a egg/cheddar bagelwich on an everything bagel, while I ordered the stuffed challah french toast&&&&food+service
There were several choices of Seattle's Best coffee at the self serve condiment bar, and I think three different types of milk&&&&ambience+food
Coffee was good&&&&food
After a few minutes the food was served to us&&&&food
My french toast (stuffed w/ cream cheese and fried) was delicious&&&&food
The only downside of the plate was the fruit that came with it&&&&ambience
There was much honeydew and cantaloupe (both of which I dislike) and precious few slices of delicious strawberry&&&&cost+food
I also had some of my wife's sandwich after she was done, and thought it was good, bagel was nice and warm still&&&&ambience+food
Craving fries and a coke&&&&food
Took me 20 minutes to get through the drive thru&&&&ambience+food
I had to pull up and wait for my drink&&&&food
That's what I get for cheating on my diet&&&&food
My first visit, some hobo had a long conversation with me in the dining room about how he helps out the store by changing their trash and other things, which I'm sure is illegal, that visit my food was fresh though, which makes it worth it for me&&&&ambience+cost+food
Second visit the lady up front had her back to the counter while she was stocking which is fine,&&&&ambience
the thing was she noticed I was there and NEVER acknowledged me&&&&food
Another worker came up and asked her if she took my order than she turned around and looked at me than turned back around and took a drive thru order on her headset&&&&service
dang, she totally neglected the front counter&&&&ambience+service
I believe in second chances though so I came back a few weeks later and got perfect service from one of the night time managers, she was really tall and African American&&&&food+service
I don't remember seeing her name, very nice lady&&&&food
Food was again fresh, which was perfect&&&&ambience+food
Worst McDonalds ever, ordered 4 mcchickins and 4 mcdoubles and a halfcut sweet tea with no ice&&&&food+service
I got sweet tea with ice and only 3 mc chickens and 3 mcdoubles&&&&food
Never go here unless you want your order fucked up&&&&service
Don't they have idiot proof ordering systems in there? I see them beeping and whirring away&&&&service
Yet any time you come here, you don't get the right food&&&&food
I give it a 3 to let people know that their drive-thru is the slowest I have ever been through&&&&ambience
Sat in the drive thru forever with no service&&&&food+service
Even as cars lined up behind me the girl was only taking orders from the other lane&&&&service
I finally gave up after the 3rd time she took the other lanes order over mine&&&&service
all this does it confuse the workers&&&&service
I've placed orders and by the time I reach the cashier she's forgotten it and I am often asked "Which order was yours?"&&&&service
Finally I drove around and went in to order&&&&service
I saw all of the employees standing in the back laughing and joking, no one was up at the counter&&&&ambience+service
When the counter employee finally saw me, she gave a huge sigh and acted like I was bothering her by being there&&&&ambience+service
I have occasionally gone there around 4-5am and am not surprised to be waiting up to ten minutes for food&&&&food
No, that's not an exaggeration, I timed it at a few seconds over 10 minutes last trip (with only two cars ahead of me)&&&&food
As far as the food goes, I haven't had an awful experiences&&&&food
They usually get my order right and the food is what you'd expect at a McD's, you're just going to wait an awful long time for it&&&&food+service
I needed some food fast - and so opted for fast food&&&&food
Ordered a Filet O' Fish sandwich and a bottle of water&&&&food+service
Sandwich was made to order - hot and delicious&&&&ambience+food+service
The cheese was melted just right, the tartar sauce was perfect, and the bun was soft and fresh&&&&ambience+food
Hit the spot&&&&ambience
All employees are not happy, not enthusiastic to work&&&&service
I've been going to this one for 20 years and it is still by far the slowest service of any&&&&food+service
Late at night I think they only have one girl doing everything, taking the orders, collecting the money, cooking the food, and handing it out the window&&&&food+service
This is probably a management and staffing problem&&&&service
I go next door to rallys and I'm in and out in no time, and they are very friendly at rally's&&&&service
The decor and table settings are extremely charming&&&&ambience
The bistro is attached to an art gallery that features art and handcrafted pieces from local artists&&&&food
My friend was interested in trying this place because of the fried green tomato BLT and she said that it did not disappoint&&&&ambience+food
I ordered the turkey pita wrap with black eyed pea hummus (that I requested on the side) asiago french fries with a cucumber rittiata (sp?) dipping sauce&&&&food+service
My meal was delicious&&&&food
All of the ingredients were fresh and extremely flavorful&&&&ambience+food
The hummus tasted like they had just prepared it as I ordered (and not took it out of a pre-made package)&&&&food+service
For beverages, we both ordered the White Peach Iced Tea and it was very refreshing&&&&ambience+food+service
I found the prices to be quite reasonable, not at all extravagant&&&&cost+food
The price of my turkey wrap was $8&&&&cost+food
50 and the drink was $2&&&&food
About the same as you would pay at any mid-level chain restaurant&&&&cost
I look forward to coming back and trying the fried green BLT and just about everything else on the menu&&&&food
Went to Maddi's for Sunday brunch and the food was delicious&&&&food
Started with a cup of good coffee and yummy fried green tomatoes&&&&ambience+food
Finally got to place our order&&&&service
I had the Portabello Wrap, which was well cooked,&&&&food
The spicy mustard took over the sandwich and kind of killed my tastebuds a bit&&&&food
My dining partners had an omelet and gumbo (reviewed favorably), the fried green tomato BLT (which disappeared off the plate quickly enough to indicate its deliciousness) and the "Birkdale Breakfast" (which was on par,&&&&ambience+food
Assuming the wait for our waiter was not a regular thing,&&&&service
a fluke of the day, I'd recommend this place for a delicious, "new southern" brunch&&&&food
The food nods to Southern influence&&&&food
All of the dinnerware and glassware are handmade, which really adds to the charm&&&&ambience
They also serve these delicious sweet potato muffins with both brunch and dinner that are to die for&&&&ambience+food
However, we have noticed that Maddi's has declined over the last couple of months&&&&food
During our latest visit, the shrimp with grits was truly tasteless - there was no seasoning in the dish&&&&food
The fried chicken, while still tasty, has shrunk in portion size&&&&food
Their soups are ALWAYS so thick it's like eating sludge&&&&food
However, we still go back because some dishes are consistently good (like the filet mignon or the fried green tomato sandwich)&&&&ambience+food
The waiter was awesome&&&&ambience+service
well priced, good portions, and delicioius&&&&cost+food
A definite must for any Charlottean looking for a new brunch spot&&&&ambience+food
the service was mixed&&&&food+service
sassy, lazy, rude, bad servers and poor drink mixers&&&&food+service
(When I pointed out that he had substituted 2 ingredients in a drink and was missing a third, he said "yeah&&&&food
)We have gone twice in the past week, and both times the food was pretty blah&&&&food
), overcooked, and a lot of good ideas just missed the mark&&&&food
For example, the mac and cheese was insanely soggy, the fried chicken was dry and the french toast with apples had tough, unpeeled apples inside, and already had the syrup poured on top when it arrived at the table&&&&ambience+food
after going twice and experiencing the same problems both times, I would say that they have either gotten lazy or had a change of staff&&&&food+service
Very interesting space and nice&&&&food
Thought the food was a little over priced for what you got&&&&cost+food
The service was extremely slow and the food wasn't even that great&&&&food+service
,Maddis is more a gift shop&&&&ambience
Try going back with an open mind and look for a bit of whimsie&&&&service
Really outstanding food&&&&food
I thought the menu lacked a little bit of creativity and selection,&&&&food
The fried chicken was absolutely perfect&&&&food
they turn the tables over very slowly and it is a small restaurant&&&&ambience
Unfortunately, Maddi's at Birkdale has closed&&&&food+service
Gross how can anyone serve food from a pig pen&&&&food
With employees acting like it was high school running all over the manager&&&&service
This place is a health hazard with the back having food everywhere&&&&food
Amd mike the guy on the register giving food away to his friends making paying customers feel like he was doing us a favor for taking my order&&&&cost+food+service
Everything is kept really clean and the inside is really modern&&&&ambience
They are also one of the nicer locations around, because it was built from the ground up&&&&food
It's actually a nice place&&&&food
The staff has always been friendly, and service is usually quick as well&&&&food+service
They even have some high stools around some tables that make for convenient quick meals, rather than the typical fast-food style seating&&&&ambience+food
It's nice and appealing&&&&food
Sweet Tea Report&&&&food
What really sets this location apart is their sweet tea&&&&food
this Taco Bell may have some of the best sweet tea out of any restaurant in Charlotte&&&&food
Definitely any fast food restaurant,&&&&food
Unfortunately, you have to hit it right because depending on who makes it, the tea can be good or it can be bad&&&&food
I know, all you haters of Taco Bell are crying about the chicken places that have good sweet tea,&&&&food
Taco Bell - or at least this taco bell - has some dang good sweet tea&&&&food
Farmer's BBQ has some good Peach Sweeet Tea,&&&&food
for regular old sweet tea, I'd put this stuff up against just about anyone (if you get a good batch)&&&&food
It's kind of pointless having 2 sides to cook food on and you're only operating off of one with only one person working the line&&&&food
Then on top of that because you're running one line with one person everything piles up and it takes forever to get your food when it should only take a few minutes at the most&&&&food
Even better is the fact that they constantly mess up the orders over and over again&&&&service
I mean sometimes I just want Taco Bell and sadly this is the closest one around my house unless I want to drive forever down the road&&&&service
To top it off the sanitary in this place is horrible&&&&ambience
Constantly food all over the floor and your feet stick to it&&&&food
Yet it never really looks like anyone cares to clean&&&&ambience
They got my order wrong I get home the Sierra mist had no syrup in it they wouldn't replace my drink and they forgot half of my order&&&&food+service
I get home and call Taco Bell and they refuse to replace the food that they forgot to put in my bag unless I bring back the whole order&&&&food+service
I explained to her this is not my fault like hell am I going to have food here and not eat it right now I'm hungry that is the point of drive-through and she hung up on me&&&&ambience+food
Taco Bell is definitely my favorite fast food and out of all the locations that I go to I would have to say that this is my favorite the staff is always friendly and the managers always take their time to say hello---5&&&&food+service
Want a lot of food for not a lot of money? Come here&&&&food
It's a fun looking room with colourful drapes and attentive service for a buffet&&&&food+service
For two people, they brought us one naan bread, cut in half which is a bit stingy if you ask me&&&&ambience+food
The salad selection is pretty miniscule&&&&food
The onion baji and fried other thing were cold and didn't have the crunchiness that is so welcome in food like this&&&&ambience+food+service
I applaud the order of the line-up of food&&&&food+service
Apart from dessert towards the beginning, it is a very logical setup for putting together my plate&&&&ambience
The food is ok at best&&&&food
Butter chicken's chicken has hard, unappetizing chunks of fat on the meat with bones and the lamb curry's lamb is also very fatty in an oily sauce&&&&food
We ordered more naan bread and were not charged&&&&cost+food+service
I liked the eggplant dish and the spinach though it could have had a lot more of the advertised cheese&&&&food
Despite this, we still went for two rounds of food, learning from our mistakes and left feeling very full&&&&food
The once incredibly pleasant servers were now sitting around a table, discussing something that was more important than greeting me&&&&ambience
Although there were a fair number of both meat and veg options to choose from, the curries mostly looked inspired&&&&ambience+food
The saag that I chose was rather bland and had only one lonely cube of paneer in it&&&&food
ter sauce (sans chicken) was a much better balance of spicy and sweet&&&&food
While the server was visibly displeased and inconvenienced by their running out of pre-made naan at the buffet table, it must have been my my lucky day since the freshly prepared naan was definitely worth the wait&&&&ambience+cost+food
Now if business could just go back to booming, perhaps Indian Flavour could manage to churn out consistently quality food again&&&&food
We should have known when we walked in to Indian Flavour at dinner time to find it deserted except for one lonely table by the window&&&&ambience
It's just early, we said, sitting down and ordering the buffet&&&&service
My water glass is spotted and stained&&&&ambience+food
My partner finds unidentified substance in his water&&&&food
Our hopes for the food were dashed&&&&food
Grease and salt were the prime ingredients as every dish was coated with oil and salty beyond belief&&&&food
It was so bad that I had to push myself to have a second plate, and didn't even bother to try their rice pudding dessert&&&&ambience+food
At least I didn't overeat at this buffet&&&&food
Well-meaning&&&&service
understaffed&&&&service
I got to check out the dinner buffet where one waitress had to take care of all of several tables&&&&ambience
The kitchen was having a hard time keeping up with the food supplies&&&&food
They ran out of Naan pretty frequently&&&&food
The lamb curry was too slow coming that they just removed it from the buffet selection leaving nothing&&&&food
The tandoori chicken was a rare sight too&&&&food
ter chicken was decent&&&&food
the ice cream was too hard to properly scoop, given that they didn't actually have an ice cream scoop&&&&food
I'd say come only if you need to fix your Indian food craving&&&&food
Great burger, especially for a Food Court&&&&food
First they have Great Burger, and the right balance between al-carte and signature burgers&&&&food
Second, good friesThird, options,&&&&food
Such as Salads, these are real salads, it you want to be a little be healthy&&&&food
Regular Burgers, Organic and Halal&&&&food
Almost $14 dollars for their 'best' burger' with a small serving of fries and soda&&&&food
If you've ever had a real hamburger you know this place is way overpriced compared to the amount and quality of food they serve&&&&cost+food
Had the big smoke burger, pouting and onion ringsBurger was deliciousGood portioning on the pouting and onion ringsFast friendly staff---4&&&&food+service
I went there as I heard they serve Halal burgers&&&&food
Firstly they charge about a $1&&&&cost
They do have beef and chicken patty&&&&food
We were two so we ordered one each&&&&service
We ordered the Big smoke burger and Spicy chicken burger&&&&food+service
Lets start with the taste, the beef tasted ok&&&&food
their chicken tasted good&&&&food
the bun was too thin to hold the burger together&&&&food
Both burgers were cooked properly and were still juicy, they also put sauteed onions on top which help out as they put a tiny bit of lettuce leaf&&&&food
The fries were to die for they tasted smokey and were very enjoyable&&&&food
All in all its a decent joint to have a burger and enjoy some food&&&&food
I just had a hamburger&&&&food
They are very cheap with the condiments, all I had was mustard and ketchup on my burger and there was barely any on it&&&&ambience+cost+food
Luckily I waited until I was home to eat and just added more to my liking&&&&food
McDonald's puts more on their burgers than this place did, and that's saying something&&&&food
I was not asked how I would like it cooked and that is probably why it was ' well done'&&&&food
I normally like my burgers medium to medium-well and this burger had no pink whatsoever&&&&food
I did not get anything else during this visit because I knew I was going to eat at home&&&&food
Fries don't normally travel well&&&&food
I will go back again in the hopes that this was just an opening week glitch on the time they need to cook their burgers&&&&food+service
I love Big Smoke Burger on Yonge Street&&&&food
I had a pretty good Big Smoke Burger experience on King West&&&&food
So I order the spicy burger combo and I watch the dude slap my patty on the grill&&&&food+service
I really had to restrain myself from being a back-seat griller and shouting out, "Hey, buddy, how about you try controlling those flare ups, please&&&&food
" Just as the dude is about to pull my patty off the grill, the other guy says, "It's a spicy," so the first guy puts my surely overcooked patty back on the grill and covers it with grilled onions to warm up the onions&&&&ambience+food
They left that overcooked patty with the onions on the grill for another three minutes or so as my burger loving soul died a little more&&&&food
Black on the outside, dry as MDF on the inside&&&&food
I knew this was happening and I said nothing because I assumed people who are paid to cook burgers everyday know more than I and because I didn't want to be one of those people&&&&cost+food
You end up with a dangerously  blackened (seriously dangerous, read the studies about blackened grill meats)  burger and a little of your soul dying as a good burger goes up in flames (literally&&&&food
I would have brought it back,&&&&ambience
I was in a big rush and I didn't have time to watch them ruin another patty&&&&ambience
The Big Smoke head office people need to get on this situation and do some remedial training for this crew&&&&food
This is unacceptable&&&&ambience
It doesn't taste pleasant and it's not safe to eat&&&&food
Stopped At square one after work and noticed  they were Doing renovations in the food court&&&&food
Decided to try something new and walked over to big smoke burger&&&&food
I settled for a regular cheese burger and side poutine  to see if they could impress me with the basics&&&&food
My combo came up to 12 dollars with a fountain ginger ale&&&&food
There were Actually char marks on my burger and I could taste the smokey flavour&&&&food
The ingredients tastes fresh and paired together nicely&&&&ambience+food
I actually found for once in my life there was more burger than bun&&&&food
it was delicious&&&&food
They use real cheese curds and it tasted like a beef base gravy&&&&food
I will definitely be back to try one of their more gourmet burgers and a side poutpout---4&&&&food
The burger patties are very juicy and tender&&&&food
I used to come here a lot when they first opened, ordering the classic chicken burger&&&&food+service
Expensive for a burger ($9)&&&&food
it was freshly made in front of you&&&&ambience+food
Last time I was here, i had the most unprofessional service&&&&food+service
I waited 30 minutes for a burger that they forgot about&&&&food
When I kept asking where my burger was they kept saying it was next (&&&&food
they just put the chicken on the grill&&&&food
After 30 minute and about 5-7 people getting their food ahead of me I asked for my money back&&&&food
They literally threw my money back at me and whipped the burger in the trash&&&&food
All done by the manager&&&&service
not square one Food 4/5Management/Experience 0/5Price 2/5---2&&&&cost+food
Ordered the organic burger because for some reason, I'm super into organic food this week&&&&food+service
One of my weird weeks (I usually go healthy, unhealthy, Asian, salad and soup and only have one of those for the entire week)&&&&food
The burger tasted good and had an okay bun - slighty soft,&&&&ambience+food
As for the beef itself, it was juicy,&&&&food
It was almost $11 for the burger and a ginger ale, which is kind of pricey&&&&cost+food
Also, even though this was a fast food joint, the service was good&&&&food+service
They said it would take 7 minutes and being the nerd I am, I timed it and it took less than 4&&&&food
Not bad burger,&&&&food
not awesome&&&&ambience
Nothing special just expensive, better off going to mcds, burger king&&&&food
Def more affordable & decent selection&&&&cost
Came here for Yelp's Burger Binge&&&&food
Big Smoke was supposed to offer a $5 Spicy Yelp Burger,&&&&food
instead they served me a Classic/Regular Burger&&&&food
I didn't check the special on the Yelp site prior to ordering, so I didn't realise that they changed it up until I got home and reread the special&&&&service
I asked how much it was to make it a combo (fries + drink) and it was almost +$5 extra&&&&food
So there has been a definite price increase since my last visit&&&&cost+food
Burger didn't taste any different than the other chains, Burger King/McD's/etc&&&&food
Good, great poutine&&&&food
Burger tastes like Burger King&&&&food
Probably the best Halal burger you can find in the city&&&&food
Their fries are also great&&&&food
I got the classic* big smoke burger as recommended by the employee there&&&&food+service
The fries here are so good&&&&food
Reminded me of nyc fries&&&&food
So I love a nice juicy burger that maintain shape for as long as it can haha&&&&food
At first this burger maintained shape&&&&food
Roughly 3 bites till finish it becomes quite sloppy which is OK for me since the middle is all gone&&&&ambience
The meat was amazing the bun was grilled, sweet onions, some kind of exotic cheese I don't know how to spell or remember and a tomato that didn't come out on first bite&&&&ambience+food
Oh man it was quite a nice burger haha&&&&food
Great burger - have tried organic and lamb&&&&food
Great fries&&&&food
Would eat more often, however, only downside is it is in Square One so cannot drive up and take out - have to eat there&&&&food
They should open up an outside location in Mississauga&&&&service
We need more quality gourmet burger places/options&&&&food
I really enjoy this place and it is my favorite of the chain burgers&&&&food
a delicious juicy patty made the way I want&&&&food
My only complaint is the price&&&&cost+food
$10 for a 4oz cheeseburher and a root beer or $15 for a combo is crazy&&&&food
again everywhere seems to be raising their prices lately so I guess it's to be expected&&&&cost+food
Would be nice of they offered some low cost specials&&&&cost+food
The fries are good and thick,&&&&food
the onion rings had too much seasoning and I found it hard to eat more than a couple&&&&food
Still though, I can appreciate the fresh patties(taste like my old man used to make on the bbq,&&&&ambience+food
Absolutely AMAZING & DELICIOUS&&&&food
Bigger size and cheaper than south st&&&&cost
S is like eating a large at south street for a dollar less&&&&food
They give you more cheese curds without having to ask&&&&food
( who doesn't love cheese&&&&food
p) As for their burgers&&&&food
Well they are not the greatest&&&&food
They taste like a boxed burger&&&&food
with the price of a gourmet burger&&&&cost+food
Big Smoke made big promises, and the resounding opinion from me was&&&&ambience
"I'll save my opinion/review of the Square One revitalized food court (spoiler&&&&food
I had been meaning to visit this place for a while,&&&&service
When I stepped into line - the longest in the food court, I might add - I was expecting quality that was out-of-this-world&&&&food
not worth the experience&&&&cost
After waiting in line, a friendly server took my order, and I was a bit surprised that it costs an extra $4 just to get a drink&&&&cost+food+service
Add to that disinterested cooks and people who were behind me in line getting their food before me (always a sticking point), and you can see that I wasn't starting off on the best foot&&&&food
The signature Big Smoke burger I had was okay,&&&&food
considering the price (something like $13 after tax for the combo), it's past the point where I consider it to be acceptable value for the money&&&&ambience+cost+food
The fancy ingredients they listed out in the menu didn't really amount to much for me, taste-wise&&&&cost+food
I was more impressed by the frosty mug they gave to me for my soft drink, and that was the high point of the experience&&&&food
The beef burger is really satisfying and the toppings have always been fresh,&&&&ambience+food
BSB is definitely more expensive than burger joints of similar quality&&&&food
The main advantage here is the convenience of the location (in Square One)&&&&ambience
Classic 6oz beef burger (not combo) is $6&&&&food
79 - you choose from ketchup, mustard, mayo, jalapeños, pickles, red onion, tomato, lettuce&&&&ambience+food
Switching to Halal costs $1&&&&cost
this is steep for Mississauga when there are options like Burger Factory and On The Bun&&&&food
BSB has some good signature toppings like sautéed mushrooms and carmelized onions for a surcharge&&&&cost+food
Hoping they bring back goat cheese and feta cheese&&&&food
Took my wife to Square One for some shopping and after an hour or so we were both getting hungry so headed down to the food court area&&&&food
I mentioned to her i wanted to try out the newly opened Big Smoke Burger and she was also up to trying it out&&&&food+service
we ordered two cheeseburger combos&&&&food+service
You pretty much get to see your burger get grilled from a fresh meat patty and onto the grill while you are waiting&&&&ambience+food
the focus here is using fresh products which was also reflected in the condiments that went onto the burger&&&&ambience+food
our combo  also came with a nice helping of fries that were pretty tasty&&&&food
We really loved the smokey flavour of our cheese burgers along with the fresh bun - the combo is pretty filling with fries&&&&ambience+food
both wife and i were able to finish our plates&&&&ambience
Overall, service was very good from cashier to picking up the food , and  price was good value for a premium burger - our 2 combos with two cokes came to around $ 24 and change&&&&cost+food+service
I had a a blue burger with organic patty to satisfy a craving for a burger with blue cheese&&&&food
The burger was served with a somewhat cold bun (aren't they supposed to toast or warm the bun on the grill?)&&&&ambience+food
Also, the meat wasn't as juicy as I remembered it&&&&food
I felt I had a better burger at A&W&&&&food
My girlfriend and I love burgers and often resort to a good burger joint for comfort food&&&&ambience+food
To our surprise, the Big Smoke Burger turned out to be quite tasty&&&&food
We ordered the spicy burger which had sautéed onions, lettuce,  tomato and spicy mayo&&&&ambience+food+service
Overall, the burger was moist and had a lot of flavor&&&&food
We also turned this into a combo with a poutine and a drink and to our surprise, the poutine was also amazing&&&&food
Great flavor with the gravy, thick cut fries and actual cheese curds&&&&food
Unfortunately, the only down fall with the Big Smoke Burger was the cost&&&&cost+food
a quaint sized burger, poutine and drink came up to a grand total of $15, hence the rating of 4 out of 5&&&&food
Otherwise, if the price was a little more reasonable, it would be a perfect rating&&&&cost+food
Very friendly, helpful and the place was very clean&&&&ambience+service
Prices are fair and I will definitely be back---5&&&&ambience+cost+food
Brand new food business&&&&food
They make you a pizza, you take it home and bake it&&&&food
It's a create your own pizza place&&&&food
Such a shame because the rest of the ingredients are fresh and the staff are polite and friendly&&&&ambience+food+service
I didn't care for this pizza&&&&food
The sauce is gross and the crust taste like Bisquik&&&&food
I would rather pay the same price for an already cooked pizza&&&&cost+food
The cinnamon dessert was good though&&&&food
This pizza hurt my stomach&&&&food
HORRENDOUS customer service&&&&food+service
Kristi was rude from the moment I walked in the door&&&&service
I used to eat Papa Murphys weekly&&&&food
Great deals&&&&food
The girls were super nice&&&&food
Pizza was yummy of course&&&&food
It's always a pleasure to walk in and be greeted with a smile and over-all good service&&&&ambience+food+service
Extensive menus and yummy pizzas are a plus&&&&food
They  taste like frozen wind from Walmart&&&&food
Louis Bar and grill&&&&ambience
' After a fail attempt at getting a table at Marcello's, my boyfriend's sister suggested Wild Wing as an alternative given it was within the same plaza&&&&ambience
Despite this, after deciding on a table, we sat ourselves down and patiently waited for the lone ranger to wander over&&&&ambience
10 minutes later, she strolled over and handed us three menus with a half assed greeting&&&&food
you come to a chicken wing place, you get something chicken related&&&&food
However, I'm weird about touching my food and without fail, will always vote for the boneless option&&&&food
So, you can imagine the gut sinking feeling when the waitress reappeared 15 minutes later and she advised they were out of the boneless option&&&&food
(Why it would take 15 minutes to flip through the three page menu, [one of which consists of wing flavours to decide] in order for you to draw the conclusion that A&&&&ambience+food+service
You want chicken&&&&food
You like to play on the wild side (see what I did there?) and stray away from the traditional by getting a burger&&&&food
I will meet your lack of boneless option and go with the chicken fingers&&&&food
Upon the waitresses arrival, we were greeted by plastic plates (why on earth any establishment would be serving their meals on plastic plates purchased at their local Dollarama is absolutely BEYOND ME) and quite possibly the soggiest, stalest tasting nachos&&&&ambience
The salsa tasted rancid, and the lettuce was wilted&&&&food
Upon the arrival of my entree I encountered what appeared to look like it had come straight out of a Hungry Man frozen dinner&&&&ambience+food
the chicken fingers smelled off&&&&ambience+food
My boyfriend's GarPar chicken wings followed suit, and they were bland tasting&&&&food
20 minutes later when our waitress arrived to do a very delayed quality control check, she asked how everything was tasting&&&&food
I explained to her the lack lustre experience I was having with my meal, she stared at me blankly as she asked me several times to describe how they tasted&&&&food
they tasted freezer burned&&&&food
they tasted off&&&&food
how many other ways did I need to find in order to describe this? "Do you want another meal made?" No, I want to get out of here as quickly as possible&&&&service
instead I asked for some more sour cream&&&&food
I should have anticipated that upon her return, the sour cream would be extremely watery and very off in texture&&&&food
An elderly couple helplessly attempted to flag down our waitress whom she ignored several times before the poor woman with an evident bad hip hobbled over to her requesting her attention&&&&service
Given the destitute of people within the restaurant, it was easy enough to hear the woman explain that her chicken&&&&food
it didn't taste like chicken&&&&food
"Does it taste like freezer burn?" "Yes&&&&food
When my boyfriend went up to settle the bill, he was started to find my meal on the bill&&&&cost
Upon asking if she could do something with it given my circumstances, she sighed heavily and said she'd have to consult with the kitchen staff&&&&service
She returned two minutes later and said&&&&food
" "Well, she ate the fries, right? I'll just charge her for those&&&&cost+food
99 on cardboard French fries later&&&&ambience+food
Wild Wing, there is a reason why a number of your establishments are closing, it's only a matter of time before you, your crappy chicken and plastic china at this location follow&&&&ambience+food
Came here on a Tuesday for the wing special which was a pound and a half for the price of one pound ($12&&&&cost+food
99) with the purchase of any beverage&&&&food
It came with your choice of single sauced chicken wings (breaded/unbreaded/boneless), fries, a dipping sauce (blue cheese, ranch, sourcream, dill), celery and carrot sticks&&&&food
I ordered the blue moonshine which was a mix of blue cheese and bbq sauce&&&&food+service
My brother got the country girl which came dressed with their my thai sauce and pineapple&&&&food
Honestly, the food took a really long time to come out&&&&food
we both agreed that it tasted it pretty good compared to other well known chicken wing places&&&&food
Our server was very friendly and helpful who did periodically check up on us&&&&service
never offered us any water to start&&&&food
Instead we just got the drink we ordered for the special which was a ginger ale ($2&&&&food+service
You can definitely tell that this specific restaurant no longer anticipates for Tuesday wing eaters as the place is practically empty&&&&food
I dont really eat chicken wings as a meal, its just not my thing so I got the lucha libre tacos and all I have to say is GROSS&&&&food
Under seasoned, small and the tortilla bread was horrible&&&&food
They were COLD&&&&ambience+food
Our group was the only people in the place and we could never find our waitress she kept disappearing to somewhere into the back which is really unhelpful when we seem to the the only people in there for the entire time we were there&&&&food+service
The food honestly is hard to explain how bad it was&&&&food
I've had better food come from the freezer section at No-frills&&&&food
The food and the service were both lacking&&&&food+service
Food is not bad at all&&&&food
It's still juicy and I really like its sauce taste and choice&&&&food
The blue moonshine night cheese dipping for my daughter's fries is a smooth texture and just right flavour which even my wife loves that&&&&food
I think Wild Wing's wing has a quality on food in average&&&&food
Portion is ok compare to its price level&&&&cost+food
Only thing I am not quite satisfy which I can tell is the service it provide with the price&&&&cost+food+service
I mean the service from getting reception to table&&&&ambience+food+service
The waiter told us it is around 15 min&&&&service
Wait time on the food is not fast&&&&food
Place are big, clean&&&&ambience
definitely a sport bar is quite noisy for family&&&&ambience
Be sure you reserves for table otherwise you will be frustrated unless you want to sit in the bar side&&&&ambience+cost
I cannot say Wild Wing is very bad in food,&&&&food
service wise, it needs to be improved in order impress people to come back for a second visit&&&&food+service
Or unless they have a very good price or food quality or speciality, otherwise, it is even hard to impress a not-so-demand guy to come back a second time&&&&cost+food
I came here on a Sunday night after failing to get a table at All Star Wings&&&&ambience
It was empty when my group an I arrived, with only one table occupied&&&&ambience
We all ordered wings and I liked that it came with fries&&&&food+service
While we were waiting for our order, I started noticing a washroom/sulfur smell and everyone noticed it too&&&&ambience+food+service
The smell was still there even as we were leaving&&&&ambience
The food was very lacklustre and the wings reminded me of frozen breaded wings you'd get at a grocery store&&&&food
Overall, I would give the food one star and another star for the service&&&&food+service
We had friendly attentive service, food was fresh, place was clean&&&&ambience+food+service
The place is nicely decorated and it's easy to get parking&&&&ambience+cost+food
The staff are friendly and the food comes out quickly&&&&food+service
We tried pho, pad thai and a green curry - all delicious&&&&food
This place is a really good find, the prices are reasonable and everything is fresh&&&&ambience+cost+food
We ordered Pho and since they recently opened, the owner gave us an appetizer of mango salad, plus We also got a 15% off our bill&&&&cost+food+service
The service was great&&&&food+service
Food came quickly and was tasty&&&&food
Very good food for decent prices&&&&cost+food
The atmosphere is nice and peaceful too, don't be discouraged from the exterior&&&&ambience+food
Although i wouldn't recommend ordering their shakes if u didn't being ur own straw because their straws are literally so thin, that ur drink will be undrinkable&&&&food+service
We asked them for a thicker straw&&&&food
The food was very fresh and quite tasty&&&&ambience+food
The mango salad was very nice,&&&&food
lacked heat&&&&food
The Tom yum coconut chicken soup tasted okay&&&&food
was a bit too sweet&&&&food
It could have used more coconut milk as it was a little watery&&&&food
The vermicelli with beef and lemongrass was very nice although it also didn't need the celery&&&&food
The restaurant and washrooms were clean, bright and very pleasant&&&&ambience
The service was excellent and very friendly&&&&food+service
Never fill the cups all the way up and unless you ask for extra toppings you get hardly any&&&&ambience
Previously we had a couple nice blizzards here&&&&food
The drive through line was looooong and sloooow&&&&ambience
And ultimately not worth the wait&&&&ambience+cost
We were not able to find the location and when we called the, "manager in charge" told us she didn't know where she was located at hung up the phone&&&&cost+service
Finally, we asked asked for a General Manager, only to be told he is out of town&&&&service
There is no-one else to speak to besides the 16 year old acting manager who doesn't know where she is located at&&&&service
Would not recommend this location if you want good customer service&&&&food+service
Ordered a large pina colada regular and it has zero flavor&&&&food+service
I like to get the strawberry julius here about twice month - it has been consistently good every time&&&&food
It has been a LONG TIME since I've enjoyed a DQ treat&&&&food
I ordered a Heath bar Blizzard in size small&&&&ambience+food+service
It was delicious&&&&food
Customer service at this corner suite at the mall was nice&&&&food+service
It wasn't busy and the 2 workers were attentive and patient with the 4 of us (me, my 2 girls, and one of their friends)&&&&service
The place was clean and the worker was helpful in directing us to the nearest bathroom (about 20 steps away)&&&&ambience+service
We should have ordered the mini&&&&service
Sounds pricey until you start eating it&&&&ambience+cost+food
We definitely feel like we got our money's worth&&&&cost
I can't promise I'll frequent this place (I mean, I DO have a waistline to consider),&&&&service
One more piece of advice, eat it outside&&&&food
DQ Blizzard + 103 degrees = "It's nice outside&&&&food
Love the deal for ice cream cones and that is what I have tried so far&&&&food
I will come back to try food items&&&&food
The staff was very friendly greeted us coming in  I had the strawberry cheesecake blizzard and my cousin had the oreo blizzard i will definitely return to this location---5&&&&food+service
If you're going for ice cream or a Julius&&&&food
not the place to grab a quick lunch&&&&food
Ordered BLT&&&&service
and the meat tasted old&&&&food
All food selections are pretty unhealthy&&&&food
No salad to substitute for chips&&&&food
Chipotle is probably a better, fresher, and healthier choice (depending upon what you choose)&&&&ambience+food
Staff are rude and did a poor job on the order&&&&service
Our advice is to STAY AWAY&&&&food
I used to live a block away from Bivy and it literally was one of my top highlights of living in that neighbourhood&&&&ambience
Something about paying $20 for a couple of eggs and potatoes drives me nuts&&&&ambience+cost+food
- Intimate&&&&ambience+service
not crowded- Rarely a wait- Generous portion sizes- I almost always order the Ploughman Platter,&&&&ambience+service
have ordered their salads in the past (Farmer Salad) and was not disappointed- I bring all my friends and guests here - many of whom ordered their Croque Monsier and raved about this plate- Great pricesYou won't regret it&&&&ambience+cost+food+service
- Unbearably cold in the space&&&&ambience+food
No pate/terrine, flimsy toast, canned(?) sliced ridged pickles - what happened here&&&&food
?- My friend's Croque Monsieur (also a usual fan fave) was so saltyService was also slow and unattentive this afternoon&&&&food+service
This is the most unassuming, underrated, unsung hero in the Dundas West strip&&&&cost
The chicken salad is packed with great stuff and so reasonably priced, the omelettes are always perfect, and the one time I came for dinner I had the jerk mussels which were excellent&&&&cost+food
It's so inexpensive and so delicious, the only thing I'm nervous about is that everyone is going to catch on and I'll have to wait to get a seat&&&&food
The brunch is one of the best, and most affordable in the city&&&&cost
You rarely have to wait for a table and the service is good&&&&ambience+food+service
That makes Bivy a real gem in the often over-priced, over-hyped Toronto restaurant scene&&&&cost+food
Everything on the brunch menu is great&&&&food
I would highlight the Croque, The Farcou (original version), the Tartiflette and the french toast&&&&ambience
Their potato salad and green salads are always fresh and delicious&&&&ambience+food
I'm told the coffee is excellent ( I'm a tea drinker - their selection is good)&&&&food

I've been a faithful daytime attendant for weekend brunch, weekday lunch, a coffee and a pastry-fuelled afternoon of work&&&&food
I've always absolutely loved my experiences with their unbelievably friendly and attentive staff and their delicious food&&&&food+service
They hit it out of the park with their farçous (spinach pancakes) and omelettes, both of which I keep coming back to&&&&food
I've also loved their tartiflette (potato/cheese tart) and the healthy bites I've had sharing plates of the kravitz, the ploughman, the gravlax&&&&ambience+food
Basically I'm a well-meaning mooch, and my partner and I regularly wind up splitting our plates because everything is so tempting&&&&ambience+service
Most of their meals come with a perfectly composed salad with mixed greens, thinly sliced radishes and a beautifully light vinaigrette and&&&&ambience+food
their phenomenal potato salad&&&&ambience+food
Everything is just really delicately balanced and flavoured just right&&&&ambience
Finding a decent and well-priced steak is a real difficult task in Toronto,&&&&cost+food
Their entrecôte steak frites comes with a grilled 10 oz rib eye prepared at a perfect medium rare as requested and covered in an understated herbed&&&&food
ter, fries that are seasoned just right and done to the perfect crisp without being overcooked and, of course, that beautiful simple salad&&&&food
Pair it with one of their well-priced glasses of wine and you have the perfect date night&&&&ambience+cost+food
We'll be back again soon, probably tacking on an order of mussels to start since they look SO good&&&&service
I just really love this place and it's the perfect local spot&&&&ambience
It's equal parts cafe, brunch/lunch stop and great dinner option&&&&food
BIVY is great at doing simple, delicious food and providing a versatile ambiance with great service&&&&food+service
The only problem is that I'm constantly tempted to say "Let's just go to BIVY" instead of, you know, cooking at home and not blowing my paycheque on daily jaunts to my favourite neighbourhood spot&&&&ambience+cost+food
Bivy is a contemporary Canadian brunch spot with a French influence&&&&ambience
Upon entering during the day, the restaurant gives a relaxing vibe for customers to sit down and enjoy their meal or coffee&&&&food
Bivy has brunch and dinner hours, which you could come in for dinner from Tuesday through Saturday&&&&ambience
Bivy serves interesting dishes, such as their French spinach pancakes and their different version of the French toast (which is more of a bread pudding)&&&&food
The beer served are sourced locally from Ontario&&&&food
The alcoholic drinks consists of beer on tap and basic cocktails&&&&food
To give back to their customers, Bivy has a policy of giving one free cup of coffee to a customer everyday&&&&ambience+food
This is an awesome policy and a great way to brighten up someone's day&&&&ambience+food
It has a nutty taste to it so it is great if you like that flavour&&&&food
Overall, I think Bivy is a nice spot to go to for a quick brunch with friends or your significant other during the week&&&&ambience+food
Good portion sizes and yummy food&&&&food
This is a reliable lunch/brunch spot that is a very relaxing place to hang around during the weekdays&&&&ambience
I almost always get the spinach pancakes with house smoked salmon (weekends) or bacon (weekdays)&&&&food
As well, delicious cookies, and shortbreads are only 3 for $1&&&&food
Ordered the Countryside Farçous&&&&service
French spinach pancakes served with Montreal Smoked meat, mixed greens & potato salad 12&&&&ambience+food
These pancakes were Gluten free baby&&&&food
Not the traditional idea of a fluffy pancake, rather more of a lightly fried spinach and egg crepe&&&&ambience+food
The smoked meat served with the pancake was a bit too salty,&&&&food
was easily balanced out with the fresh mixed greens and potato salad&&&&ambience+food
My lunch companions ordered the Salads with Bivy dressing 10&&&&food+service
75 - A generous portion of fresh greens and a balanced serving of toppings&&&&ambience+food+service
9/10 - Overall excellent food, meat was a tad too salty&&&&food
10/10 - Perfect spot for a lunch meeting&&&&ambience
Modern décor, spacious, plenty of seating and music volume wasn't overbearing&&&&ambience+food
8/10 - Water service needs improvement&&&&food+service
Friendly staff&&&&service
Quick service for a lunch hour&&&&food+service
It's a little brunch place that is really chill, the menu is small and simple and the food is great&&&&food
I've had their omelette and their quiche and was not always happy with my choice&&&&food
not a gigantic plate of food that would make me feel sick for the rest of the day&&&&ambience+food
Their prices are fair&&&&ambience+cost+food
No line, no loud music, no pretentious waiter&&&&ambience+service
So, nobody knows this place is now open for dinners, apparently&&&&service
No wait, great service, delish food and the place all to yourself&&&&food+service
The food is delicious and always so fresh&&&&ambience+food
It's not heavy or greasy, just good quality ingredients&&&&ambience
the recently JUST OPENED FOR DINNER&&&&service
Tuesday thru Sun they are open until 9&&&&service
I love this little french inspired bistro and hope it stays open&&&&service
The Parisian owner Pascal is lovely and has a lot of pride and love when it comes to his food&&&&food
Great find&&&&food
Had a wonderful open faced tuna sandwich served with lots of fresh salad&&&&ambience+food+service
Friendly staff and reasonable prices&&&&cost+food+service
This is a great place&&&&food
The food is really good&&&&food
what impressed me the most were the prices&&&&cost+food
It is cheaper than Swiss Chalet (aka Swiss Pigeon) and like 10x better quality&&&&cost
I had duck confit and my father had the Ribs, both were great and cheap&&&&cost+food
Discovered this place from my "Indie Coffee Passport"&&&&food
Went for a morning coffee,&&&&food
Ordered the "Baked French toast", WOW it was very good&&&&food+service
Nice small place, quite, good food and friendly services&&&&food+service
Overall we were shocked by how good the food and service were from the salad to the mussels and the duck confit&&&&food+service
Best of all is the price which you would expect to pay double for&&&&cost+food
We go out to eat about once a week all over the west end and this was one of the best dinner experiences we have had in a while&&&&food
Everything from the mains to the sides to the coffee were exceptional&&&&food
The fresh goat cheese, the spinach pancakes, the salads, the quiche&&&&ambience+food
Perfect portions and delicious&&&&food
Came here today during the Dundas West Fest, I haven't explored this side of the city yet and had no clue where to eat, my stomach was growling and this cafe appeared at just the right time&&&&food
I ordered the Eastern (sun dried tomato hummus + roasted red peppers + goat cheese + baby spinach) and the man in my life ordered the Tuna Twist  (flaked tuna + mayo + avocado + hard-boiled egg)&&&&ambience+food+service
Wow both sandwiches were divine, extremely fresh and tasty&&&&ambience+food
Lovely flavors and friendly staff&&&&food+service
Had the vegetarian spinach pancakes as well as a veggie sandwich - both with the amazing potato salad on the side&&&&ambience+food
Second time there for Brunch, delicious&&&&food
The croque was delicious and we both agreed it was one up on Bonjour Brioche - which has held this accolade for some time&&&&food
The other thing I have here is the Farmers Salad which just makes me feel happy and well fed&&&&food
Fresh food from whole ingredients, consistently prepared well&&&&ambience+food
Great coffee&&&&food
Reasonable prices&&&&cost+food
Friendly, unpretentious service&&&&food+service
Music by Monkees&&&&ambience
Great food and good coffee awesome service what else can you ask for&&&&ambience+food+service
The Bivy is a good spot in Little Portugal,&&&&ambience
They serve decent coffee--not the best, not the worst--, they serve brunch and dinner, and they have a liquor license, which gives them the opportunity to sell alcohol too&&&&food
This leads to an unfocused attention on certain items they may want to do better, the coffee being one of them&&&&food
The tables and chairs seem to work well with the place and actually brighten the place up&&&&ambience
The staff are very friendly and willing to serve everyone well&&&&service
The place is a great place,&&&&food
Is it a great coffee place? Is it a great brunch spot? Is it a great place to get a night cap? There isn't an identity here&&&&ambience+food
I've come here twice now&&&&food
First for coffee/tea and a cookie&&&&food
The tea is higher quality than what you'd find at most cafes in the city - very fragrant and flavourful&&&&food
The baked goods are excellent&&&&food
the farcou and croque monsieur were impeccable and well-priced&&&&cost+food
Perhaps the ploughman's is for more adventurous eaters&&&&food
This was the first time I'd gone for brunch in ages where I didn't have to wait in a line for a table&&&&ambience
What a refreshing change&&&&ambience+food
Also, staff was SUPER friendly&&&&service
Initially the purpose of this trip was to get cappuccino from the Indie Coffee Passport (ICP)&&&&food
once we saw the brunch menu we decided to to eat here as well&&&&food
My friend decided to order a french toast and I went for Poire Helene since I am a sucker for pear desserts&&&&food+service
For the ICP we both ordered a cappuccino&&&&service
The service is decent here and we were checked on regularly and the server even shared her fav on the ICP&&&&food+service
The food did take its time to arrive though even though the we went at off peak hours&&&&food
Raisin haters beware as they do use raisin bread&&&&food
below averageMilk&&&&food
The decent food gives it a bump to 3&&&&food
They did push their dinner and gave us a discount coupon for that&&&&cost
My first visit to Bivy was during the DuWest sidewalk sale&&&&cost
I went in when they were slammed and waited quite a while for a take out order&&&&service
The wait was worth it&&&&cost
I had a house cured salmon sandwich and it was great&&&&food
My wife and I just went for brunch today and I had the French pancakes with again their house cured salmon, a nice mixed green salad and potato salad, which I believe comes with every dish&&&&ambience+food
My only suggestion would be some form of creme fresh or sour cream to compliment&&&&ambience+food
Friendly service, and a nice atmosphere, complements your experience&&&&food+service
A bit of a diamond in the rough of that area&&&&ambience
I thoroughly enjoyed my Salmon entrée&&&&ambience
was able to share the steak that my wife had and would order that next time&&&&food+service
The duck was also delicious and I enjoyed that as well&&&&food
Service (by Patrick) was discreet and relaxed to fit the ambiance&&&&food+service
Worth a trip to that part of town for food from a genuine French chef and owner Pascal&&&&cost+food
The interior is pretty much on par with most of the other restaurants that have popped up in this area in the last couple years, with reclaimed wood interiors with small candlelit tables&&&&ambience
We started with the charcuterie and spicy devilled eggs to start&&&&food
Both were tasty and appropriately priced,&&&&cost+food
the devilled eggs were admittedly not actually spicy&&&&food
Still tasty,&&&&food
adding a dusting of paprika is hardly spicy to me&&&&food
Then as a second course we split an order of ribs, which were decent,&&&&service
a little to overpowering in the citrus based acidity&&&&food
As a main, I rounded out my meal with the pulled pork sandwich with fries&&&&food
The pulled pork was admittedly less acidic than the ribs and more savoury&&&&food
The spinach in the sandwich was a nice addition&&&&food
the tomato and mayo just made me realize the flavor of the pork isn't impressive enough if relying on additional sauces and juicy vegetables to affect its flavouring&&&&ambience+food
In the end for 4 beers, the 2 apps, an order of ribs and 2 mains came in a bit over $100 after tax and tip&&&&service
So for what we turned into a 3 course meal, was perfectly adequate in price and results&&&&cost+food
The menu is a pseudo all day breakfast fare with some lunch options too&&&&cost
Farcous is a spinach pancake, flat and crispy&&&&ambience+food
They have a traditional which is mixed also with red onion and cheddar, among others like with smoked meat&&&&food
It comes with a big salad&&&&food
My friend got the ploughmans platter, a mix of smoked salmon, hard boiled egg, pate with a salad and other things&&&&food
I wouldn't come out of my way to eat here,&&&&food
The food surprisingly is good given the price of the dim sum&&&&ambience+cost+food
We order the beef ball and it comes with 4 balls, most of the restaurants only have 3&&&&food+service
One of the baked pie and sweet milk pudding that we ordered are not that good, the rest are above average&&&&food+service
You cannot beat the price with the quality in the location around&&&&cost+food
They are CLOSED&&&&service
Looking for a new dim sum place, we ended up at Golden Crown Dynasty Cuisine&&&&ambience
High ceilings, bright yellow walls, and actual cloth table coverings&&&&ambience
Sure, there was a giant grease stain in the middle of the table,&&&&ambience
The dim sum menu is extensive and they have some neat items&&&&ambience+food
* I really liked the spicy shrimp dumplings with XO sauce&&&&food
* The siu mai had huge shrimps and was fresh and piping hot&&&&ambience+food
* Sticky rice was okay&&&&food
* Beef noodle roll had celery in it&&&&food
* We gave the crispy abalone pastry puffs a try, they didn't taste too much like abalone though&&&&food
* The escargot pie with Portuguese sauce was tasty&&&&food
very sweet* For dessert, we ordered the two colour crystal balls&&&&food+service
Tasty dessert dumplings where you could see through to the filling (red bean and custard)The food was freshly made and the portions weren't bad&&&&ambience+food
Overall, I had a nice dim sum experience and I will return if I'm in the hood&&&&ambience+food
Price is 5&&&&cost+food
And it opens at 8am&&&&service
just ordered 7 dishes and the bill came at 20&&&&cost+service
79 loved all dishes in the fried section&&&&food
Congee was yummy too&&&&food
My chinece fiancé and I found a nice new breakfast place for a change&&&&food
Every time food has been quick, yummy and a good price&&&&cost+food
Today I had the Ploughman's Salad, which I thought would arrive in a small plastic container and I'd have to eat with those horrendous plastic forks&&&&food
But no, a big plate of ham, cheese, egg, two kinds of pickle, lettuce and tomatoes landed on my table and I was mighty impressed&&&&ambience+food
First of all, it produces amazing flavourful soups which tempt you to come back day after day&&&&food
Every day they have 3 varieties of soups and you get a large hunk of baguette to go with it as well&&&&food
So for example a large cup of tomato & bean soup to takeaway is £1&&&&ambience+food
One day I was hesitating between two flavours and the lady kindly offered a wee sample for me to taste which I thought was a nice touch&&&&food
In fact all the staff there are super friendly and always smiling, which is another reason to go there&&&&service
Cafe Marmalade also does nice salads, wraps, sandwiches and cakes&&&&food
They also sell portions of home made foods, e&&&&food
looked it up and was horrified by the reviews, and fearful of food poisoning&&&&food
It looked okay, when checked out the place--maybe a little unpleasant, in that some of the tables were uncleared and so on,&&&&ambience+service
It was pretty full, with only a couple of seats going to spare&&&&food
The woman who seated us seemed curt and sullen, however, there was a man who served our table for the most part (the woman refilled our tea once)&&&&ambience+food
The man was friendly, smiling and helpful&&&&service
I didn't get food poisoning, which always raises my rating of a restaurant where raw fish is served by one star&&&&food
The ones made for us last night didn't look like they were made by a "blindfolded 8 year old cutting with a hacksaw" (as another reviewer eloquently put it--perhaps a different sushi chef, or else she encountered she same sushi chef as we did,&&&&ambience
Taste-wise, they were fine,&&&&food
One special note is the spicy salmon roll&&&&food
Last summer at a sushi place on the Danforth whose name I do not recall, a friend warned us away from the spicy rolls&&&&food
He said that they use crappy cuts of fish and disguise it with the spicy sauce&&&&food
I had never heard of such a thing--we often have sushi out in Waterloo (as we live there part time), and it has always been fine--the same cut of fish as the regular roll, with some spicy sauce drizzled over&&&&food
Last night, I saw what my friend meant&&&&service
The spicy salmon roll featured finely chopped salmon, mixed with the spicy sauce--and closer examination confirmed that yes, the lighter stuff in the chopped meat side was not merely sauce,&&&&ambience+food
I tried a bite and this reinforced my friend's warning, which I now pass on to you, with the note that at least for now, in Waterloo, this is not the case&&&&food
There, the spicy rolls are not crappy cuts of meat disguised by spice&&&&food
But sadly, at least some AYCE places here, no doubt faced with higher overhead and fierce competition, seem to have decided to take short cuts where they can least afford to--on the food itself, while hoping that the flat rate AYCE pricing will make up for it&&&&ambience+cost+food
The fact that I won't rush back to this place indicates that at least for me, the pricing doesn't make up for it--I'd rather have a tasty bento box, well-prepared, than such mediocre AYCE&&&&ambience+food
*I think my rating would more accurately (from the descriptions) be "meh--I've had better" because this is precisely true&&&&cost
But, most people seem to be writing really horrid reviews alongside their two star ratings, so I assume that 2 stars is actually more negative than that and three stars is more of a "meh" in practice&&&&food
For all the local foodies and those who prefer quality customer service&&&&food+service
We made a decent size order on what we assumed would arrive in reasonable portions(it is an all you can eat after all) the sizes that came were gargantuan&&&&food+service
Starting with udon noodles that was the size of a full entree(oversized) after a minor complaint to the owner who barely acknowledged our annoyance the rest of the food came&&&&ambience+food
Which was just as ridiculously large followed by more of a sour attitude&&&&food
My boyfriend and I head to pay the bill and left promptly to take photos of the resto to review later&&&&ambience+cost+food
Yes I said it my fellow foodies&&&&food
Then runs back inside to grab two glasses of water and douse him and myself with it&&&&ambience+food
This was both staggering and unacceptable&&&&ambience
Convenience won the day&&&&ambience
alas, no horrifically crappy service or explosive diarrhea to speak of&&&&food+service
The service was good, the food was decent&&&&food+service
They could've given me more rice though&&&&food
And wondering whether they still serve salad with their hands? Ignorance is bliss&&&&food+service
Bad quality for a cheap price&&&&cost+food
When you taste the chicken and say is this actually cooked enough that is enough to say this place is horrible&&&&food
After watching a great Hot Doc, my fiance and I were hungry and saw this place directly across the street&&&&ambience+food
Service wasn't so good&&&&food+service
Our waitress barely spoke english and was not very attentive&&&&ambience
Never noticed even a smile out of her&&&&food
We were seated near the front of the restaurant and felt a draft everytime the door was opened (also, there was a piercing squeak noise that happened everytime the door was pushed open all the way)&&&&ambience+food+service
Now onto the food&&&&food
sushi was so so with too much rice used&&&&food
Most of the had a pickled taste to it&&&&food
Grilled meat tasted a little grisly and wasn't cooked enough&&&&food
I guess you pay for what you get and I should have walked further down the street t an a la carte sushi place&&&&cost
service was still good&&&&food+service
We were promptly served our tea and water when we sat down, and the two waitressess tag-teamed our table returning multiple times through the meal to top up both types of drinks&&&&ambience+food
We came for the All You Can Eat (AYCE) dinner on a moderately busy Saturday night - there may have been 4 or 5 other tables being served along with us&&&&ambience+cost+food
On the weekends, the price is apparently raised by $1, so instead of it being $15&&&&cost+food
99 weekend price,&&&&cost+food
my buddy said that one doesn't come with Sashimi, so we went with the higher priced one&&&&cost+food
It wasn't great (I lived in Vancouver and have had GREAT sushi back in the day)&&&&food
in my opinion it wasn't gross as some have suggested by any means&&&&service
The presentation on our plates was also nice, as our multiple rolls and sashimi came out nicely presented (and our white salmon sashimi - which comes in thin strips - was presented looking like the flower of a rose, a beautifully artistic interpretation that I hadn't seen before&&&&ambience+food
Nice and fresh&&&&ambience+food
Sushi rolls do come with a lot of rice,&&&&food
they were tasty too&&&&food
They had a few rolls I'd never seen before like the "Excellent Role" (I know, how awesome of a name is that&&&&ambience
) which was shrimp and banana&&&&food
On the AYCE menu there was only 1 dessert, tempura friend Banana, which they pour a little chocolate over, and it was actually quite tasty&&&&food
When we finished, they also offered us complimentary ice cream (Green Tea or Coconut flavours)&&&&food
I was spoiled living a few years on the west coast&&&&food
The AYCE menu is pretty thorough with lots of choice, and the price is decent&&&&ambience+cost+food
that's not an rating option in Yelp, so this restaurant will benefit from the automatic round-up to 4-stars&&&&ambience
Food was average and they didn't have the torched sushis, service was surprisingly slow since they had about three servers working and not a lot of people to serve&&&&food+service
Weird service and you spend some quality time in their bathroom soon after you eat something from their all-you-can-eat menu&&&&food+service
Thank god I live nearby so I could rush home and spend time in my own bathroom&&&&ambience
Too much rice filled with vinegar&&&&food
Subpar if not rude service and stairs that you can die on walking to the washroom where you will want to vomit from the overpriced, terrible eating experience you just had&&&&ambience+cost+food+service
Got sick from eating here and regret giving these owners any money&&&&food
Don't believe the signs or the location, this place will be bankrupt soon and is a disgrace to sushi everywhere&&&&service
Head over to Big Sushi, Sushi on Bloor or really anywhere on the street you will have food that is 30x tastier with much nicer staff&&&&food+service
However, the last time I went back to this place in September, the sushi rolls were basically the size of a coke can with an extremely big overload of rice&&&&food
I would actually consider it a rice ball more than sushi&&&&food
all we ended up getting were the rolls first and by the time we got through the rolls we had no more space for the sashimi&&&&ambience
Bottom line, they tried to fill us up with rice so that we would eat less of the sashimi or other food on the menu (cheaper for them)&&&&cost+food
Even the lady serving us felt bad and understood when we wanted her to take away the remaining of the rice clumps&&&&food
I love this AYCE and even for takeout, I go out of my way to come to Mariko because the rolls are big and the sushi is fresh&&&&ambience+food
But yes, this is an affordable AYCE sushi spot with good customer service--they're pretty sweet and smile and work hard&&&&ambience+cost+food+service
You get a choice to eat off the 16&&&&food
the price is good&&&&cost+food
The service is nice with a smile&&&&food+service
Keep in mind this is in the university area and meant to be affordable&&&&cost+service
I realized at the end of the meal that I forgot to take pictures so only managed to get the vegetarian rolls&&&&food
Which they have many vegetarian options&&&&food
Also the fried banana tempura with chocolate is yummy&&&&food
The first time I walked in to Mariko, I sat at a table waiting for almost 15 minutes for someone to take my order before choosing to just leave&&&&ambience+food+service
The rolls were mostly rice, falling apart from poor construction, actually lukewarm, and the fish (what there was of it) was definitely not fresh&&&&ambience+food
The "spicy sauce" that covered some options seemed to be little more than a greasy spiced mayonnaise-like goop that I might expect to see at a roadside Denny's&&&&ambience+food
A server dressed in dirty sweatpants? Dust-covered exposed wiring tangled around the tawdry lighting fixtures? Never again&&&&ambience+food
This isn't somewhere one goes for the ambience and I'm sure the service varies depending on who's working on a particular evening,&&&&ambience+food+service
I went here for the first time with a friend last night, and our waitress was very friendly and helpful&&&&service
The sushi was also fresh, delicious, and well prepared (the $17 AYCE)&&&&ambience+food
The sashimi is always top notch and the service is usually pretty good&&&&food+service
They offer two all you can eat menus that are very reasonably priced and have a decent variety as well&&&&cost+food
it took more than half an hour to get our food (and they were not busy), when we did finally get it the food was inedible&&&&food
the rice was soggy & so was the tempura&&&&food
The staff was barely competent and even after interrogating me as to why i could not eat more than 5 pieces would not even take a dollar off the almost 30 that disgusting meal cost me&&&&ambience+cost+food+service
We get great food -- though sometimes a bit uneven&&&&food
Never had soggy tempura here (or agedashi dofu), though occasionally have had sashimi that was still a bit cold from freezing&&&&ambience+food
Never had poorly rolled rolls, or otherwise sub-par food&&&&food
No language barrier for us, and we have an established relationship with the servers/chefs&&&&ambience
Under these circumstances, the food is excellent&&&&food
It is not quite as clean as it used to be before the remodel, and service can be,&&&&ambience+food+service
But for the price, its been unbeatable for an all-you-can-eat sushi fix&&&&ambience+cost+food
Good service and a lot of vegan and vegetarian choices in a super reasonably priced "all-you-can-eat" @Bloor & spadina&&&&cost+food+service
Consistent quality and bottomless tea&&&&food
99 AYCE price&&&&cost+food
My boyfriend wanted to celebrate a win by taking me to AYCE and we decided to finally cross off Mariko on our AYCE hit-list&&&&cost
99 all-you-can-eat, we didn't have any high expectations of the food quality&&&&food
Food was average-below average&&&&food
Tempura was never crispy (and if you think that's an undercooked yam tempura, no, it's just carrot&&&&food
) The salmon sashimi was probably the only highlight of our night, though they were poorly deboned&&&&ambience
30PM and our first order didn't come in until 10&&&&service
There were only three other tables&&&&ambience
It was like this with all our orders until closing time&&&&service
I guess on the bright side, we finally paced ourselves at AYCE and there were a set of flies that entertained us as we tried to keep them off of our chopsticks&&&&food
Service though? Really bad&&&&food+service
Like, I don't think I've ever been this baffled by service in my life especially since my entire family (also Chinese) works in the restaurant scene&&&&food+service
No plates for anything until we asked for them during our second order&&&&ambience+service
Water has no ice and was lukewarm&&&&ambience+food
I would not be surprised if it was like those restaurant stories my parents tell of places that rinse utensils in drinking water&&&&food
Communicating with the staff is terrible&&&&service
They're always in a rush (to not serve the other customers) and were really condescending&&&&ambience
the staff is just plain grumpy 24/7&&&&service
We were charged an extra ~$4 due to some miscommunication and after waiting for our waitress's 20 minute phone call to end, we flagged her down&&&&cost+food
We disputed this charge&&&&cost
instead of rectifying this issue (sounds familiar to some other yelp reviews?&&&&ambience+food
) they asked why we even bothered coming here instead of the other AYCEs on Bloor&&&&food
W-what? We were willing to pay the extra charge since it was a misunderstanding on both ends and it was only $4&&&&cost
They eventually removed the charge and we even *tipped* them (something I will regret to this day&&&&cost
) I was even more put off by how fiercely the waitress grabbed the money off of the table sans the tray by slamming her palm down on the bills and&&&&ambience+cost+food
But hey, its all you can eat so I guess you just have to accept how mediocre all the food is&&&&food
Yes, it's cheap&&&&cost
They come out mostly rice with one tiny slice of rotten avocado or cucumber as an afterthought, doused in that sickingly sweet glaze sauce that makes everything taste better&&&&food
The decor is cheap and dated&&&&ambience+cost
I can't rememer if the service was horrible or not, so it was probably adequate&&&&food+service
There's cheap and&&&&cost
there's Mariko cheap&&&&cost
not awesome either&&&&ambience
Can find better for the price,&&&&cost+food
Today I tried the chicken Katsudon, and once again flavor was fit for the price (bowl wasn't small, so you get some value)&&&&ambience+cost+food
So me and my girlfriend wanted to eat some sushi and we went here to give it a try and to me it's was pretty crappy&&&&food
Their sushi rolls are bad because the seaweed and the rice are old&&&&food
Not worth the money at all&&&&cost
They're getting 2 stars because the staff are nice and if you order more than $8 you get a choice of 3 pieces of dumplings or sushi&&&&food+service
The red snapper shashimi was soggy and mashed up&&&&food
The waiter could barely comprehend what I wanted to order&&&&ambience+service
I was ordering takeout and I asked for a fork with my garden salad&&&&food+service
It was difficult just paying for the order--as she seemed so distracted and wasn't on hand to take my cash&&&&cost+service
Mediocre food, poor service---1&&&&food+service
The best part about Marikos is the price&&&&cost+food
Sadly when i went by on December 12th there was an eviction notice in the window&&&&food
Somehow, even the miso soup is awful&&&&food
the cups tasted like soap&&&&ambience+food
still seemed unclean, and the bowls had little flecks of paint chipping off&&&&ambience
The rice was bordering on crunchy, the "spicy salmon rolls" looked like dog food smothered in a pinkish hot mayo, wrapped loosely in what I guess was supposed to be a roll&&&&ambience+food+service
I bit into the "sweet and sour chicken" to find it was almost entirely raw on the inside&&&&food
We tried to wash everything down with plentiful amounts of water from our soapy, dingy cups,&&&&ambience+cost+food
the server ignored us entirely and did not refill our cups&&&&ambience+service
We were one of two couples in the place, and yet we were entirely ignored for most of our time there&&&&service
When my boyfriend went to pay, he saw the cook sleeping in a booth&&&&cost
I work at a restaurant as a food runner, and if there is one immutable law of bringing food to a table, it is that you serve all the people at the table as close to simultaneously as you can&&&&ambience+food
I came here with my girlfriend a couple of weeks ago, and, given that we are a mere table of two, the difference in time between our receiving of meals should be measured in split seconds&&&&ambience
My meal came first, and when it became apparent that hers wasnt coming any time soon, I tried my utmost to exercise self-control in eating my meal&&&&food
Given that I was sure the fish wasnt the freshest to begin with, I didnt much like the idea of sitting and watching it get older,&&&&ambience+food
About 15 minutes later, we had both had enough&&&&food
I was given the green light to begin eating&&&&ambience+food
By the time I was finishing my meal, roughly 15 minutes after that, her meal finally came out&&&&ambience+food
Her avocado Salad consisted of  a whopping amount of iceberg lettuce and a whole quarter of an avocado&&&&cost+food
We both left the restaurant in a pissy mood, and our hunger was only slightly put off&&&&ambience
As far as cheap sushi on bloor goes, you can get better for cheaper&&&&cost
Cheap sushi, especially for all you can eat&&&&cost+food
But I've had my order "rejected" from delivery because it's too busy in the restaurant&&&&service
Usually when reviewing Toronto sushi places I talk about how the food was bad&&&&food
the service was amazing&&&&food+service
The food here was ok&&&&food
Three kinds of maki, all rolled properly, well seasoned rice, avocado and salmon were fresh&&&&ambience+food
Miso soup was very savoury&&&&food
Salad dressing was awesomely tart&&&&ambience+food
Chicken teriyaki was fine&&&&food
Tofu was superb&&&&food
Mountain of food for a low price&&&&cost+food
It was soggy&&&&food
When I walked it in took three minutes to be noticed, greeted, and seated&&&&food
There were two servers and only four occupied tables (and they were standing about, not at the tables)&&&&ambience
The menu is huge so a couple minutes later I'm still holding it in front of my face reading it and a server comes and says "Are you ready yet?" and I suppressed a "Yes, I'm just reading now for the entertainment value"&&&&food
I order and it takes too long to get to me&&&&service
While waiting I notice there is a dinner ayce menu which was never offered to me&&&&food
would have been nice to be told about it&&&&food
When she brings my food my water is empty&&&&food
She looks at glass&&&&ambience
Ten minutes later she walks by, glass is empty, looks at it, doesn't fill it&&&&ambience+food
Five minutes later another server fills it&&&&food
I must have tired out the girl by asking her for water because she disappeared&&&&food
As I eat I notice the floor is disgusting&&&&food
Chopstick here, lump of rice there, no effort to do anything about it&&&&food
I also notice the server that didn't disappear is just chilling up front drinking a bubble tea instead of working&&&&food
I finish the food&&&&food
Wait 20 minutes, never see a bill&&&&cost+food
As I do I find server #1 sprawled out in a booth taking an effing nap&&&&food
Can you imagine? Server two says "Do you want to pay?" and I suppress a "No, I'd just thought I'd do laps of the place to work off the bento"&&&&cost
25 on the counter and walk out&&&&ambience
The food is AMAZING and cheap as it gets for AYCE&&&&cost+food
That being said, if you are expecting ambiance and five star service, you're at the wrong place&&&&food+service
We have never really had an issue with service, in fact, because we are regulars, we have established a relationship with the regular server and the chefs&&&&food+service
as such, when they are in we get special treatment (free drinks, special sushi not on the menu, etc&&&&food
Bottom line, for the price, the quality of the food is top notch&&&&cost+food
Yeah this place pretty much uses pretty poor quality of fish and small cuts&&&&food
We did not order the all you can eat either&&&&food+service
99 all u can eat&&&&food
The service was slow and sub-par&&&&food+service
The food was really bad and the worst sashimi I have ever tasted&&&&food
99 right?  Well  when i went to pay they wanted to charge us 17&&&&cost
After a brief argument the one waitress called the manager on the phone screaming in Japanese  and finally charged us 10&&&&cost+food+service
99, still insisting she told us when we ordered that we were getting the more expensive menu??  SHE DID NOT&&&&service
she than yells at me saying Im never welcome again&&&&service
she than barked  at me again&&&&ambience
At this point I had enough and told her where to go, at which point the waitress turned around and slapped me in the face twice  YES  she actually physically assaulted me&&&&food
shoved me into a table&&&&ambience
I'm still pondering pressing assault charges just not sure if i want to waste any more energy on it&&&&cost
Just don't eat here, trust me&&&&food
They forgot our order not once - not twice-&&&&food+service
Each time we had to fill out a new order sheet and give it to them and they lost it each time&&&&service
Not to mention the food was an embarrassment&&&&ambience+food
So, for people who only like Veg, Chicken, or Beef in their rolls and no fish you don't have to pay full pop&&&&cost+food
The decor is in keeping with the nicer sushi restaurants in the area&&&&ambience+food
Way too much rice on the sushi&&&&food
I know there is supposed to be rice on sushi, I'm not freaking out over carbs&&&&food
There was hardly any fish in the rolls&&&&food
Where are the nice big chunks of salmon and tuna? The rolls were not well assembled&&&&food
some where falling apart when picked up with chop sticks - the sign of a poorly trained (if at all) sushi chef&&&&food
We like to order a lot of sashimi&&&&service
The second round was clearly cut the tail end of the fish were there is more marbling and fat&&&&ambience+food
It's creamier consistency is better for some rolls,&&&&food
The severs were nice,&&&&food
When you're given a menu and pen/pencil to fill it out, a 4cm pencil covered in black gunk is not what you want when you're ordering food&&&&food+service
It took forever for our first order to arrive&&&&service
I'm not expecting fast food,&&&&food
at least bring out the first roll or two within 15 minutes&&&&food
you get what you pay for&&&&cost
***This place is about 30% cheaper than other AYCE sushi restaurants in the area, and the quality of the food is at least 30% lower&&&&cost+food
The food is not fresh (you can see black stuff on the avocado)&&&&ambience+food
The fish is not fresh also, the taste is a bit weird&&&&ambience+food
There are orders missing so we have to order again&&&&service
When the order came, there is soooooooooooo much rice on the roll (i never see that much rice in a roll)&&&&food+service
Even the yam tempera is not sweet&&&&food
too bad i forgot to take picture of the food to prove myself&&&&food
Food is horrible&&&&food
The AYCE signs outside are a come-on, and the whole thing is a scam because the rolls are 90% rice&&&&food
Fish is NOT FRESH&&&&ambience+food
And they serve the cheapest (i&&&&cost
, fried/rice-heavy) items first and conveniently 'forget' about the sashimi, etc&&&&food
Staff is incredibly rude&&&&service
Floors and tables are filthy- would hate to see what their kitchen looks like if this is their cleanliness standard&&&&ambience
My buddy, Eric, and I come here for lunch pretty much every Tuesday and order one of their lunch specials&&&&service
25, you receive miso soup and a bento box with chicken teriyaki, rice, salad, 4 California rolls and two tofu cubes (somewhat sauteed)&&&&food
Hey, you also get a bottomless cup of green tea&&&&ambience+food
Healthy and a terrific deal&&&&food
Can't beat this place&&&&food
And, after all these years, the staff knows us so it's kind of like walking into Cheers for us&&&&service
Honestly, the rolls are DELICIOUS&&&&food
They're generously sized and you get so much variety for the $15&&&&service
99 all-you-can-eat dinner&&&&food
They're so good and fresh--nothing tastes cold or stale&&&&ambience+food
Sashimi is included in the all-you-can-eat price&&&&cost+food
The rice was hard, the fish was poor quality, and the sashimi cuts were small and sad&&&&food
Service was poor and there were an incredible amount of flies in the restaurant&&&&cost+food+service
For just over $15 you can get AYCE of plenty-palatable fish (and whatever else you want)&&&&ambience+food
I eat a lot of salmon and tuna, and they are always good+&&&&food
I'm not a fan of the sushi pizza,&&&&food
everything else I've eaten has been very enjoyable&&&&food
dumplings, skewers, seaweed salad, various rolls, nigiri, sashimi&&&&food
Ambiance is not great, and the plastic water cups sometimes taste like cleaner,&&&&ambience+food
I find Mariko to be a solid sushi meal at a great price&&&&cost+food
I was in a hurry for a take-out order&&&&service
The place is FILTHY, starting with the front door, fingerprints, and dirty floors&&&&ambience
The first thing I clocked inside were the Chinese (nothing Japanese here) employees and owners' SHOES thrown on the floor in front of the 'sushi bar&&&&ambience+service
Mops are visible, brooms, and crap surrounds the food area&&&&food
The first banquet is totally covered full with papers and plastic bags, there are filthy chairs that need to be tossed they are so dirty dirty dirty&&&&ambience
The staff who wore dirty tops barely understood my order, and though the prices are good, the food made ever so slowly by a tired elderly Chinese gentleman (who looked as though he should have his feet up in front of TV not working) was the worst I have ever had&&&&ambience+cost+food+service
IGNORE any reviews that like this place, those are not people with any food standards whatsoever&&&&food+service
I have been several times and have always enjoyed the food and found the service to be very good&&&&food+service
I eat a lot of sushi and I have most of the sushi restaurants in the area&&&&food
NO CAN DO, until I offered to pay more money to avoid eating crap&&&&cost+food
*rolls eyes*I ordered the Wakame Salad, which came drenched in a disgustingly sweet sauce of sesame&&&&food+service
Not a drizzle, a SOUP of dressing covering the few leaves of wakame is not my idea of a good Japanese salad&&&&food
The miso soup was standard&&&&food
I only got 2 tofu cubes&&&&food
I also got the chicken teriyaki which was not what I was expecting, it came as a sizzling hot plate instead of drenched in that thick lovely soy sauce and flavoured beautifully&&&&ambience+food
It lacked seasoning, was on a bed of horribly cooked onions and carrots, and I was so hungry, I ate it all&&&&food
-even though the place was reasonably busy, the service was quick&&&&food+service
- edamame and anything sweet for desert are a la cart and not included with the AYCE - kinda odd-Water was brought to the table and we were never asked if we wanted anything else&&&&ambience+food
I certainly would have expected tea rather than water&&&&food
The refilling of the water glasses was labored at best&&&&ambience+food
The fish seemed a bit on the old side - kinda soft and mushy - maybe it'd been frozen? dunno&&&&food
The udon broth was kinda tasteless&&&&food
a little greasy - same was true for the gyoza, not bad,&&&&ambience
a bit greasy&&&&ambience
I came for the AYCE and remind me never to go for all you can eat&&&&food
MSG induced perhaps?  I never feel like I get my dollars worth since I don't eat that much&&&&cost+food
Unfortunately I don't remember what I ordered&&&&service
Sure, it may be relatively cheap for an AYCE,&&&&cost
starving to death is also cheap&&&&cost+food
At least with the latter you can die a dignified death and not have your hippocampus tarnished with the memory of ever coming to this place&&&&ambience+food
With poor service, a menu with text printed in the smallest size font in faded red (ask the staff for a magnifying glass if you don't have your electron microscope handy), low quality fish, and a whopping 7 conditional passes from Dinesafe(&&&&ambience+food+service
Considering the rising presence of Japanese food in the area, such an environment should've put this place out of its misery ages ago&&&&ambience+food
I've only been for AYCE, and while for the price I don't anticipate stellar service, I do simply ask that my request to have my food not come in contact with animal products be respected&&&&cost+food+service
I don't need sterilized separate utensils,&&&&cost
not having to return a large plate of avocado maki that is covered in roe would be awesome&&&&ambience
Even in my omnivorous days, fish and seafood grossed me out&&&&food
This kind of experience doesn't really help the matter much&&&&ambience
The prices are solid if you have no dietary restrictions, and they've never once cut me off, even though I can devour an inhumane amount of food&&&&cost+food
I've visited Mariko on Bloor (near Bathurst) twice now, and was surprised to see it wasn't listed on Yelp yet&&&&food
They always seem to have some sort of special on, which is great for students&&&&food
tofu & miso on Sundays)&&&&food
Both times I have been there, service has been brutal&&&&food+service
There were times that the waitress was just sitting at a table with her head down, and one of the chefs would come over to serve us after our failed attempts to get her attention&&&&ambience
The first visit, I ordered à la carte, and the food came out beautifully prepared and displayed&&&&food+service
It was all just laid on a big plate in rows&&&&ambience
The salmon sashimi came out in super thin slices, yet all still stuck together by some fatty tissue at the corner&&&&food
And the fish just did not seem like sushi grade&&&&food
I was so disgusted, I didn't re-order anything&&&&service
But even the spicy salmon roll was purely mushy, and it appeared that the chef hadn't cleaned his prep area between preparing rolls&&&&ambience+food
Rolls that weren't supposed to have fish eggs on them had a few scattered bits of tobiko around the outside, that clearly didn't come from just being on the plate&&&&ambience+food
It's so important for sushi chefs to use clean surfaces when preparing different rolls or fish&&&&ambience+food
The interior is a cold blue, and the lighting is just as unwelcoming&&&&ambience+food+service
I think they've installed fluorescent lighting panels on the walls, and put transparent images of bamboo over them, as if they could act as sconces&&&&ambience
FAILWe overheard a diner behind us asking the waitress to recommend something delicious he hadn't tried before, and she suggested the dynamite roll&&&&food
If you're going to try it, my only advice is not to go for the AYCE&&&&food
It's just not worth it in the end if you can't enjoy your meal&&&&cost

The Fox Bistro is the restaurant at the Radisson so we were assuming that the food would be fine and gave it a try as we had a coupon for it&&&&food
As you walk in, the first thing you notice is that it is very dated inside, and the bar crowd&&&&ambience+food
We were the only table in the whole place besides some people staying at the hotel watching the world cup and having some drinks at the bar&&&&ambience+food
The waiter wasn't paying any attention to us at all, he was busy watching the game with the guys at the bar, we had to keep getting his attention&&&&ambience+cost+service
If we were the only table don't you think he should of gave us just a little more attention?When the food finally came, I saw all these yellowish looking stuff on my sandwich, the description said mayonnaise NOT HONEY MUSTARD SAUCE&&&&ambience+food
I dislike mustard and I was shocked to see honey mustard all over my sandwich, I have never seen a club house with mustard on it, so I was very surprised&&&&food
The lasagna looked very portion packed and when we asked about it, the waiter said "its frozen, we just heat is up" you would assume for 20 bucks at least could  make their own lasagna&&&&food+service
What's the point going to a restaurant to have something heated up when you can do the same thing at home?I'm glad I had to chance to see what this place was about as I was curious&&&&food
We went in this restaurant in the hotel because it was convenience, not my choice&&&&ambience+food
Milestones and Swiss Chalet were too busy for them on a Friday night, no one in this place so quiet&&&&ambience
Apps were good, nice French onion soup&&&&food
Do not order sandwiches, very small portions on grocery store sandwich bread and small sides - not worth price&&&&cost+food+service
I make nicer grilled cheese sandwiches at home, without finger holes in the bread&&&&food
While server was attentive, he overstayed his welcome&&&&service
We did not want to be rude, so we eventually left irritated&&&&service
I served for 12 years and would never imagine lingering unwanted at a table making conversations of my own choice to pass the time&&&&ambience+food
My girl friend and I stayed at this Radisson twice and were given continental breakfast vouchers on both occasions&&&&food
The moment we walked into the restaurant  was like going through a time machine&&&&ambience
Boy~ the decor was immensely outdated&&&&ambience
the waitresses were not very attentive at all even though we were THE ONLY table&&&&ambience
The continental breakfast only included the cold section of the break (breads, fruits and croissant&&&&ambience+food
we chose to to add $6 for hot buffet because the croissants and fruits had obviously been left for several days (no jokes, the croissant had a kind of fermenting smell to it) and spoiled&&&&ambience+food
so off we go to the hot buffet (the selection was very LIMITED)&&&&ambience+food
The scramble eggs was blah and the bacons tasted like it'd been several days old&&&&food
Stay away from this place since there are so many choices (and MUCH better) right outside the steps of this hotel (Tim Horton's, Kelsey's, Subway, Milestones, Sushi, Swiss Chalet and etc&&&&ambience+food
I'll eat anything&&&&food
I love great food&&&&food
The buffet seemed lackluster so I ordered eggs Bennie&&&&food+service

I also recently tried a bite of my boyfriends salad, he got the seafood cesar&&&&food
The name to me sounded bizarre&&&&ambience
it had crab and shrimp and was actually quite good&&&&food
I haven't tried many other things on the menu because I tend to stick to what I like (selective eater over here)&&&&food
I have tried their egg drop soup in the past which was very good as well as the roast beef sandwich&&&&food
I will continue to come back here as the prices are very reasonable, the service is amazing, and the food is always delicious&&&&cost+food+service
In a former life, I worked in an office not far from Dr&&&&food
they serve food that I can make at home&&&&food
Salads? Sandwiches? Soups? Stuff I've been banging out since Home Ec class&&&&food
What's unforgiveable is that their food turns out worse than mine&&&&food
Undercooked pea soup is grany&&&&food
salad leaves arrive with brown edges, wilting under puckery-sour dressings&&&&food
Coffee is zombie-grey&&&&food
Bread arrives with the standard packets of shelf-stable whipped&&&&ambience+food
It's already open, and the&&&&service
Clearly, Dr&&&&ambience
Just came from Sid Silver and was hankering for some salad dish with meat (as I am a meatatarian) and we ended up at the plaza corner of Dufferin and Steeles because of Cora's&&&&food
However, I noticed this small restaurant in the back corner and checked their menu on the window and made sure there were actual customers as the one beside Cora's looked eerily empty so I did not bother going there&&&&food
Anyway I went in and ordered their Chinese Chicken Salad small sized for $6&&&&food+service
I chose small because looking at the large size it seems like too much salad&&&&food
I also ordered with their sesame dressing&&&&service
Along with the salad I ordered the bacon and cheese potaato skins as the appetizer for $5&&&&ambience+food+service
So I got the salad first&&&&food
Surprisingly the bowl was not just for show, it was quite full&&&&ambience
Lots of veggies (which I was after), some pieces of chicken, Mandarin orange slices, and some fried noodles&&&&food
The tart sesame salad dressing blends well with the salad&&&&food
Don't throw the entire dressing into the salad, just do a little bit at a time&&&&food
However, something was missing in order to make me fully happy&&&&service
Thankfully the tato skins arrived and after taking a bite, the taste just balanced very well&&&&food
No free wifi&&&&ambience
However, I am happy with the price, service and quality&&&&cost+food+service
Super nice waitress, fast and friendly&&&&food+service
I love their seafood salad with unique chinese chicken ceaser dressing&&&&food
The best salad i have ever had&&&&food
The omlette i have to say taste better than mine&&&&food
If I only going review Dr Deli and the Salad Queen based solely on the food&&&&food
I would have just rated this place as a 3 star&&&&cost
we got exceptional services from the waitress&&&&food+service
My Lunch buddy has this thing for soup&&&&food
she just couldn't decide which one to go with since there are 3 choices for "Soup of the Day"&&&&food
1/2 Roast Beef and Soup ($6&&&&food
Potato Soup is the Best&&&&ambience+food
hmmm how is the chicken noodle? Waitress&&&&food
Beef and Barley&&&&ambience+food
Potato Friend&&&&ambience+food
What is Barley&&&&ambience
Finally, we decided on the Beef and Barley&&&&ambience+food
and finally after voting and intensive taste testing&&&&food
We agreed on the Potato&&&&ambience+food
It is more like a really light broth with veggie inside and it was delicious&&&&ambience+food
I usually don't want to order anything with "Chinese" when I am in a non "Chinese" restaurant&&&&service
with all these reviewers raving about Chinese Chicken Salad ($6&&&&food
and there is nothing really Chinese about the salad&&&&food
aside from those fried noodles&&&&food
The half Roast Beef sandwich on rye ended up I have to save it for pre dinner snack for later&&&&food
I definitely will come back here if I have another salad attack&&&&food
Deli and the Salad Queen, ah, good times&&&&food
As such, I feel like the quality of the food has gone down over the past few years&&&&food
We used to come here all the time, and the salad was delicious&&&&food
Don't be fooled by the cheesy decor of this "hole in the wall" type of place, because I'm telling you this is one of the best lunch spots ever and I frequent it on a regular basis&&&&ambience
The Chinese Chicken Salad is excellent, and as a veggie option you can substitute the chicken with shredded cheese (which is also very good&&&&food
) The salads are huge for the price, and be warned, a large can easily feed 2-3 people, while a small is the perfect size for 1&&&&cost+food
Their salad dressings are incredible, and I'm pretty sure they sell them in big bottles to take home&&&&food
I've only ever tried the various salads&&&&food
Now I have to say, the service is not the best,&&&&food+service
The food does come quickly,&&&&food
expect the server to disappear after you've been brought your food, and possibly not visit for the duration of the meal&&&&ambience+food
Take out is always super quick, even if you don't call your order in in advance&&&&service
The only place to get a Chinese chicken salad that is actually good, this little hole in the wall is located in a strip mall at Duffrin and Keele&&&&food
Along with delicious salads and healthy options, Dr&&&&food
Deli also has great burgers and sandwiches&&&&food
You will also get a kick out of the kitchy interior decor and the art that hangs on the walls (most items are for sale)&&&&ambience+cost
Deli has been a constant spot for me and my friends&&&&ambience
Deli is a great place for healthy food&&&&food
They have quite a few variety of Salads&&&&food
The best is Chinese chicken caeser salad (mix), the Greek seafood salad is also pretty good&&&&food
I love the service, as it is so fast and good&&&&food+service
I like the ambience, its not too rushy or loud&&&&ambience
Its not pricey, and the best place to come specially if you are diet conscious&&&&cost+food
They also have some great meaty sandwiches, if you do not happen to like salads&&&&food
The vegetables are always brown and something is always missing when I pick up an order&&&&ambience+food+service
"you did not tell me no sunflower seeds" (i did) "don't leave the salad in the car or the veggies get brown" (i never do) "my chef forgot to put in the carrots, I will give you extra next time" (I watched her make my salad, not a chef & my salad literally had lettuce, cheese and 4 mandarin oranges in it)&&&&food
I miss Vince - he would have given me a free salad as an apology&&&&food
Sandwich was okay, the fries were somewhat raw still&&&&food
Went here around noon and it got a bit busy, the staff looked like they were in a rush&&&&ambience+service
I came here for a late lunch and despite no one being around, the service was quick and efficient&&&&food+service
I really like the hot sandwich here, specifically the corned beef sandwich&&&&ambience+food
However, I am taking off 2 stars for the subpar quality of the 'caesar salad'&&&&food
I opted for the carsar salad for an extra $2&&&&food
I was disappointed with the salad as it only had some not so fresh salad and pieces of stale, perhaps home made croutons&&&&ambience+food
However, I do suggest the hot sandwich here, just don't get the side&&&&ambience+food
This is a sureshot in Longueuil&&&&ambience+food
The service is always good&&&&food+service
This was my favorite local eatery within a 5 min walk&&&&food
A little fun for the first few minutes&&&&food
I started with the warm goat cheese salad&&&&ambience+food
I used to dream of this salad at night&&&&food
The food was very delicious&&&&food
The waitress couldn't speak english so she brought us someone who could translate the menu as well&&&&ambience
The only problem was that the pizza we ordered, one slice was slightly wet&&&&ambience+food+service
The crust was soggy as if it had been dipped in water&&&&food
It's a bit pricey, and the portions are small&&&&cost+food
I had bruschetta, it was yummy&&&&food
I had the vegetarian risotto, which was amazing&&&&food
I spent $60, and the waitress forgot about me, waited nearly 30 minutes for her to pick up my payment&&&&cost+food
I had two glasses of wine and I'm a light weight so I hadn't noticed that much time had pasted, the book I was reading kept me entertained&&&&ambience+food
- Great Food- Good Ambiance- Good ServiceCons&&&&food+service
- Price- Portion on the petite side&&&&cost+food
Pour un jeudi midi ensoleillé la terrasse du Magia n'était pas très occupée, surprenant&&&&ambience
L'hôtesse n'a ma pas aidée a me rassurer mais la serveuse a été plus que charmante, mignonne, efficace et souriante&&&&food
Ma salade italienne était goûteuse et croustillante, et les penne forestier délicieux&&&&food
In the city of Longueuil, which is across the water from Montreal in what is called the south shore area, is the quaint old town area of Longueuil&&&&food
The restaurant is in a sort of old house, with the front room cleared out for diners&&&&ambience
The food is casual, and good for lunch, offering salads, pastas, and pizzas&&&&food
I had a nice Spaghetti Pancetta, which included a nice side salad, for $11&&&&food
Service in the busy lunch hour was good, too&&&&food+service
We were the first couple to arrive of a party of 10&&&&ambience
The maitre-d' looked at us, nodded towards to the table and told us to seat ourselves&&&&ambience+food
Equally rude was the waiter who actually rolled his eyes at people who couldn't decide what to eat, and who got in a shouting match with one couple over whether a steak cooked 'medium' had any red in it&&&&ambience+food+service
On top of that, the two people that ordered the sea bass were treated not only to some cheaper, tasteless fish in the guise of a bass&&&&cost+food+service
A beautiful little restaurant with five-star-worthy food at very reasonable prices&&&&cost+food
I had the chicken with oyster mushroom sauce, and my wife had the flank steak with plum sauce&&&&food
The lentil soup was hot, very tasty, and a nice start after coming in on a snowy night&&&&ambience+food
The entrees were simply awesome&&&&ambience
After sampling both dishes, we both preferred the chicken,&&&&food
that's not to say anything negative about the steak&&&&food
They were both rich and intensely flavorful&&&&food
Finally, the pear and chocolate cake with raspberry sauce was a great end to a memorable meal&&&&food
The service was good and the atmosphere was very cozy&&&&food+service
It is elegant, cozy and romantic, and the food is excellent&&&&food
We had French onion soup,which was superb&&&&food
Boy was it great&&&&food
Wonderful service with a Parisian flair&&&&ambience+food+service
Incredible food&&&&food
Reasonable price and beautiful location&&&&cost+food
Great place for a nice dinner out&&&&food
Fries are burnt, the sole is frozen, the pastas are mushy,&&&&food
ter pasta for kids has peppers in it when you ask for 3 times for just&&&&food
The waiter was nice,&&&&food+service
the mediocrity of the food makes this an over priced proposition&&&&cost+food
I had the Pavé de saumon grillé, vinaigrette tiède à l'orange&&&&food
This is a grilled salmon dish that came with mixed vegetables and I believe orzo rice?  Everything was nicely seasoned&&&&ambience+food
I guess you only get it if you order dessert&&&&service
We were in the Old Montreal part of town on Saturday June 8 looking for a spot to eat&&&&ambience+food
It was fairly chilly outside and drizzling and we had been walking for close to two hours looking at various places and menus&&&&ambience
Finally we came upon this place and it looked very quaint, with a full patio and outside heaters&&&&food
The maitre'd greeted us and informed us that their specialty was seafood, all fresh&&&&ambience+food
I love seafood so we were sold&&&&food
Went to sit inside since we were cold and wet,&&&&ambience+food
There was also a foul fryer mixed with rotting fish smell so we decided to move outside&&&&ambience+food
we ordered the calamary which was chewy, yellow and tasted old, and the snails which there were only 4 of and no bigger than the ones you get at the keg&&&&food+service
They were covered in cheese and mushrooms (of which there was no mention of on the menu&&&&food
Since they touted that they were known for their seafood i ordered the muscles and my partner ordered the fillet mignon&&&&food+service
the filet tasted as if had been in the fridge for over 3 weeks - tough with a weird spongy time of texture, and very bad flavour&&&&food
The muscles were not fresh and many did not open during the cooking process&&&&ambience+food+service
The broth - the little that existed - had no flavour other than overly salty&&&&food
very pricey, food quality sub par, service left much to be desired&&&&cost+food+service
I would not go back if you paid me&&&&cost
* Nice included breakfast *Staying upstairs in the small yet lovely seven room Le Relais Lyonnaise (http&&&&ambience+food
ca/biz/hotel-le-relais-lyonnaise-montreal#hrid&&&&ambience+food
tNEe9qqV1iexbFUbNqaS8g), the kind owner explained that he also operates this cafe, and that breakfast is included for guests in this public cafe&&&&cost
(That was a nice bonus as when booking the room there was no mention of a free included breakfast&&&&ambience+food
ca/biz_photos/28rRiCNsqRf95R6jj3ENcQ?select=WVECS2J92y8C0xZqD2aA-g)&&&&ambience+food
Every morning during my stay I had a bowl of cafe au lait and a glass of freshly squeezed orange juice&&&&ambience+food
ca/biz_photos/28rRiCNsqRf95R6jj3ENcQ?select=JIEPOJeoTRAPB0MBK5b_lwThe breakfasts were quite hearty and ranged from omelets (I had a nice cheese and herb omelet one day) to crepes to bagel with lox&&&&ambience+food
They served a fresh bagel covered with a very generous amount of lox&&&&ambience+cost+food+service
Cream cheese was served on the side, along with a side salad (typical mixed greens like from a market served with a nice dijon mustard based dressing) and some fresh fried potatoes (these were exceptionally tasty)&&&&ambience+food
I've never had salad and potatoes with my breakfast bagel before,&&&&ambience+food
Here is a photo of it&&&&ambience+food
ca/biz_photos/28rRiCNsqRf95R6jj3ENcQ?select=8ldkGMWDtAFMo5NidT5EfAI like the whole idea of stepping out of your room, going outside and heading to a regular cafe, yet being able to order whatever you'd like from the menu&&&&ambience+food+service
Nice additional touch for staying at the hotel&&&&ambience+food
An OK spot to stop for breakfast&&&&ambience
*Food (in our case an omelette and a savory Chicken Pesto Crepe) was good&&&&food
I think the omelette was probably the better choice here - my boyfriend seemed to really enjoy it&&&&food
The buckwheat crepe, which is apparently what they're known for, didn't really do it for me&&&&food
Also, skip the breakfast potatoes&&&&ambience+food
*Value - prices were a little high,&&&&cost+food
Two people with normal appetites could probably split a plate&&&&ambience
*Service - very friendly,&&&&food+service
Four stars might be a bit much, perhaps three and a half, if it were available, would be my ultimate rating&&&&ambience
My mother, who used to work here in her younger days, swears by this place, and although it has changed considerably over the years, the care and technique put into the food is still there and you can taste it&&&&food
While I wouldn't consider this place for dinner, it is the perfect early lunch/brunch spot&&&&ambience
Side salads are always fresh, excellent dressings, coffee is excellent, and the selection of desserts, chocolates and glaces are also wicked&&&&ambience+food
As a chocolate chef, I can say the chocolate here is definitely worth a visit&&&&cost+food
Somewhat pricey for lunch-fare,&&&&cost+food
The service is sometimes cold, and it can get slow,&&&&ambience+food+service
mostly you get what you pay for&&&&cost
Great terrasse as well&&&&food
I thought the food was quite good&&&&food
I highly recommend the quiche and I have it on good authority that the sandwiches from this place are much better than NYC cartfood&&&&food
Their crepes are amazing, coffee is delicious&&&&food
Nice atmosphere&&&&food
I love to sit and take my time when I go out, my family is typically European, and Ive never experienced a problem with the wait staff&&&&service
Not the best food ever&&&&food
The staff was very friendly and the service was pretty fast&&&&food+service
everything we ate there was definitely under flavored and overcooked&&&&food
We got the croque madame, deux oeufs (two eggs), and salmon omelette&&&&food
The salmon didn't taste very fresh and the Croque Madame was pretty stale and merely a ham sandwich with an egg on top&&&&ambience+food
Pastries, sandwiches,light lunches&&&&ambience
Late evening treat seekers beware&&&&food
Usually I'll order a crêpe dish while the boyfriend would go for the quiche du jour, all complimented with a pitcher of Boréale Blonde&&&&food+service
Service is so-so&&&&food+service
This is the type of resto where you'll want to dine if you're not in a hurry, since the staff is a little bit on the "taking their time" side&&&&service
Maybe that's just the rushed American in me&&&&ambience
Their buckwheat crepes are fantastic  - huge and delicious&&&&food
That said, this place has been my go to spot for croissants and coffee when I'm in Montreal&&&&ambience+food
So I would go have my croissants and coffee and read the local papers&&&&food
This place used to be a very good spot in Montréal&&&&ambience
At that time it was only a place where you drink coffe (expresso machine, of course) and eat pastries&&&&food
The choice was astonishing and they were made by highly skilled people using the very best ingredient&&&&food
Yes, now you can enjoy salad, croque-monsieur and soups, they even have added the ice cream to the menu,&&&&food
ARGHHHHHHHHHH   We only ended up here cos it was listed in "Montreal's Top 25" guidebook&&&&ambience
(Do people who write these guide books actually eat at the places they review?&&&&ambience+food
)   Dont bother going to this place - cos if you walked a little further up, there are tons of better looking places with better looking food&&&&food
The service here was slow&&&&food+service
They took FOREVER to take our orders&&&&service
The food was not worth waiting for&&&&cost+food
The soup of the day felt so thin that it was as if someone had just poured water into a pot of leftovers&&&&ambience+food
I was staying at hotel a few blocks away&&&&ambience+food
I had a smoked salmon panini and it was delicious&&&&food
The meal came with a large salad as well&&&&food
The food wasn't the most amazing ever,&&&&food
I might be being generous,&&&&service
the crepes hit the spot after walking all over old Montreal&&&&ambience
Crepe, salad and cold local beer&&&&ambience+food
Stayed for a pastry and coffee&&&&food
Un bel endroit pour des crêpes tard le dimanche matin ou pour désert/café en fin de soirée (pâtisseries fancy, chocolat, glace )&&&&ambience+food
Paninis, quiches, salade (La Lyonnaise est pour homme averti) pour lunch et souper&&&&food
Frais, bon prix, bon service, chaleureux à l'intérieur malgré le bruit de la prép&&&&food+service
You might get swept up in the romance that is Montreal and innocently assume that all restaurants on the street are going to be delicious and serve quality cuisine&&&&food
Sure, the atmosphere helps, and the cafe diners on the front patio appear to be enjoying themselves&&&&food
But, once you taste the food being served, you may not be sold&&&&food
They serve fresh squeezed juice, so everyone at the table ordered it&&&&ambience+food+service
Not realizing that we just spent almost $20 on juice even before ordering food&&&&food+service
The fabulous looking bread and pastry counter is not filled with items made in house,&&&&ambience+food
Instead I was served a decent croissant,&&&&food
nothing worth mentioning&&&&cost
The worst part of the meal were the buckwheat crepes&&&&food
We had buckwheat crepes a few days before at a different restaurant across the street and loved them&&&&food
The room temperature, floppy sponge crepes given to us were not fresh and had barely any fillings&&&&ambience+food
The chicken inside of the chicken pesto crepe was cold and dry, and barely any cheese to soften the blow&&&&ambience+food
I simply could not eat the dish, and everyone else that the table felt the same about their dishes&&&&ambience+food
My wife said the brioche wasn't genuine and was in fact just pain au raisin&&&&food
But not mouth watering&&&&food
The cafe au lait was very nice indeed though&&&&food
Service was quick and the waitress very pleasant&&&&food+service
A good place to go for a snack and a coffee,&&&&food
We were a little disappointed as our guide book said this was the best brioche in Montreal and we kind of went out of our way to get here&&&&ambience
Never have I walked out of a restaurant refusing to pay because of bad food&&&&cost+food
I sort of blame myself as if I had actually looked at this place more clearly I would have noticed how grimy and dirty the outside was&&&&ambience+food
Service started out a bit weird&&&&food+service
I asked if they had iced coffee (not on the menu) and the server replied&&&&food
Anyway, I ordered an iced latte as well the french toast with fruit and my bf ordered the croque monsieur&&&&food+service
I went to wash my hands and noticed how dark and dirty the corridors leading into the kitchen were&&&&ambience+food
Then I saw someone, who I later found out was the manager, walking from the storage area to the kitchen with my french toast in a see through plastic bag&&&&ambience+service
My iced latte arrived&&&&food
It had espresso, and cold milk, topped off with HOT FROTH and NO ICE&&&&ambience+food
Seriously? Not only is that disgusting, it's also dangerous - hot and cold milk should never be mixed&&&&ambience+food
When I worked at Starbucks this was the first thing we were taught - never accommodate any customer who wants hot foam on an iced espresso drink&&&&ambience+food
It tasted horrible and the server seemed confused when I asked for a mug of ice to help make the drink actually, yknow, ICED&&&&food
The food arrived&&&&food
It was soggy, flat and worst of all - STALE&&&&ambience+food
the watermelons that came with it would have needed a steak knife to cut&&&&food
My bf is NOT a fussy eater,&&&&food
took one bite into his sorry looking croque madame (think microwaved ham and cheese on white bread) and said ''do you want to just leave?''&&&&food
We eat out a lot, and have travelled a lot, eating in all sorts of restaurants, and this was the first time either of us ever left any restaurant anywhere because we were so disgusted with the food quality&&&&food
What was most interesting was that neither the servers nor the manager were particularly shocked when we said we were leaving and refused to pay&&&&cost+service
AVOID AT ALL COSTS&&&&cost
Lack of taste&&&&food
Lack of service&&&&food+service
My wife took the pork chops&&&&food
How can you miss a pork chop&&&&food
And the fries looked like McCain's fries&&&&food
Overcooked&&&&food
Before I put in my 2 cents in without considering that I was in fact, in another country, I will review about the food first&&&&food
I had the ratatouille with mushrooms, egg, and tomato paste&&&&ambience+food
The taste was not so great,&&&&food
this could have been a result of me eating it cold on my drive back down to NY so I will forgive and forget&&&&ambience+food
Just as delicious as they look, they ARE in fact, delicious&&&&food
I am not a big fan of desserts that are too sweet, so I had to appreciate the lightness and subtlety of the fruit tarts&&&&ambience+food
Perfect for bringing back gifts for family and friends&&&&ambience
Service is a hit or miss depending on the waitress&&&&food+service
Bear in mind that they take orders, prepare the food, AND serve it&&&&food+service
I initially wondered whether the mediocre service was because of cultural differences,&&&&food+service
people are nice and helpful in Montreal&&&&food+service
a very nice change from the city life&&&&food
Quand je me plains -poliment- à la serveuse, elle s'excuse et emporte mon assiette&&&&food

What the new Dierks Bentley bar SHOULD be&&&&ambience

They played NEW country and it was great&&&&food
Let's talk food&&&&food
Ordered the ribs for dinner&&&&service
They were not so tender and the flavor is just not that great, to me&&&&food
The cole slaw fell flat&&&&ambience
No zest, no zing, flavor just not so great&&&&food
The fries were great&&&&food
Husband ordered the Steer Here sandwich and said it was pretty good,&&&&service
we left before the live music started&&&&ambience
The Western is a fun new spot located on 5th Ave just west of Goldwater&&&&ambience+food
Live country bands, a dance floor, dim lights, good food, and cheap drinks made for an interesting evening&&&&ambience+cost+food
Live music every Wednesday thru Sunday with NO COVER&&&&ambience
The layout is western through and through&&&&ambience
The staff were all very pleasant&&&&service
I ordered the Cobb salad with chicken&&&&food+service
It is a bar you know&&&&ambience
The bar staff were awesome&&&&ambience+service
I overheard someone complaining about lipstick on her glass, they gave her a new drink and for the next two hours we watched the bar back hand polish the other glasses&&&&ambience+food
I ordered the jalapeño poppers and the were delicious (&&&&food+service
not for those adverse to heat)&&&&food
they were well performed and there was no cover charge&&&&cost
I'll say again, live music in Phoenix with no cover charge&&&&ambience+cost
So why only four stars?  It's a Scottsdale cowboy bar on the verge of becoming a legit cowboy bar&&&&ambience+food
Awful service, awful drinks&&&&food+service
Super long wait at the non-crowded bar while I had the pleasure of watching the male bartender flirt with the female waitstaff for over 5 minutes&&&&ambience+food+service
No acknowledgement or apologies from the staff for severely sub-par service&&&&food+service
The service is just plain awful&&&&food+service
I've been a few times now before deciding to finalize my opinion and write a review, and after my last visit this past weekend I'm compelled to warn people to stay away if you're looking for a place with anything resembling even mediocre service&&&&food+service
I stood at the bar (dead center, with no one standing in front of me) for over 5 minutes before the bartender even took my order&&&&ambience+food+service
It was not busy, and there is no excuse for the wait - I had to watch the male bartender flirt and laugh with the female waitstaff the entire time&&&&ambience+food+service
When he finally came over, it was after he took the order and brought beers for the guy who stood next to me, and had only just recently ponied up to the bar about a minute previously&&&&ambience+food+service
When I finally got my drink order (a very simple whisky cocktail and a draught PBR) the cocktail ended up being one of the worst I've ever had in my life&&&&food+service
Great place for country music in old town&&&&ambience+food
When you get tired of DJ's and electronic music and you're ready for some au&&&&ambience
tic music made by actual musicians, this is the place for you&&&&ambience
The minute you walk in you realize that this isn't some honky tonk dive, this is a very dark, classy place, with a large bar and plenty of seating&&&&ambience+food
This is the type of place that you would normally find in NYC, LA or Nashville, so its a great addition to Scottsdale&&&&food
In fact, it wouldn't surprise me if this becomes the place where national musicians go to play a few unannounced sets when they are in town&&&&ambience
Great place to come to have awesome drinks with your friends and listen to some country music&&&&ambience+food
Cool decorations and fun atmosphere&&&&ambience
The bar top is awesome so check it out&&&&ambience
They also have awesome customer service&&&&ambience+food+service
The bar tender Dave is an awesome guy and really knows his stuff&&&&ambience+food
He always has a great attitude and a smile on his face which makes for a great visit&&&&food
Keep up the awesome work Dave&&&&ambience
Come check out the Western for a fun time with great people---5&&&&food
Bartenders were were not very helpful, did not provide quick service, and left a lot to be desired&&&&ambience+food+service
We paid a $10 cover for a band that was okay,&&&&cost
The liquor selection was good, with top shelf whiskeys, ryes, and vodkas, an adequate scotch selection, and fairly good beer selection&&&&ambience
the cover was unacceptable and more than anything else the service was crap&&&&ambience+food+service
Save your money and go and support bartenders somewhere else&&&&ambience+food
Saw a band play and had delicious food&&&&food
Pulled pork sliders with pineapple slaw, onion rings, fries, and drinks are TASTY&&&&food
Great atmosphere and music&&&&ambience+food
I am so happy they brought back the guitar player during Friday Happy Hours&&&&ambience
The food is awesome and the bartenders are very friendly and attentive&&&&ambience+food+service
I go there once to twice a week,&&&&food
Pretty unique spot in Old Town&&&&ambience
Live country music and dancing&&&&ambience
The band was good, sound was good, vibe was good--until I walked up to the bar&&&&ambience
I appeared to be interrupting something when I walked up&&&&food
asked the female bartender how much the well drinks were and she said $5 as if she was already annoyed with me&&&&ambience+food
asked her what a buckshot was (since that was the $1 special on the board&&&&ambience+food
) She didn't have a straight answer and instead asked the male bartender, "it's uh whatever we feel like making, we'll start with whiskey?" I ordered it, what the hell, YOLO&&&&ambience+food+service
Big mistake--the "buckshot" tasted like cough medicine and corn syrup&&&&ambience+food
Before my order was complete the male and female bartender are snickering with each other as if they are sharing their own private joke&&&&ambience+food+service
that shouldn't really matter&&&&ambience
The crowd was there drinking (and tipping) these two because of the band&&&&food
Why the attitude? Before the band's set was over the male bartender starts cleaning up the venue, pushing chairs in (loudly) and collecting glasses from tables&&&&ambience+food
The male bartender and female bartender appeared to be flirting with one another in the back corner, laughing at customers, etc&&&&ambience+food
I definitely wasn't the only one that was feeling uncomfortable&&&&ambience
These two bartenders were not only chasing the crowd away&&&&ambience+food
The venue itself had a cool vibe (aside from the nu-metal blaring in between sets), the prices were slightly more than average ($5 for a draft beer, $5 for a well drink, $1 for a "buckshot") and the service, well the service was non-existence&&&&ambience+cost+food+service
Word of advice if you are the duo reading this--if your income is highly dependent upon tips, you should probably be nicer to the 20 or so people that are actually in your bar on a Monday night instead of driving them (and the band they came to see) away&&&&ambience+food
I haven't eaten here&&&&food
only came for a Friday night out on two separate occasions&&&&cost
Great live music and reasonable priced drinks&&&&ambience+cost+food
the laid back, fun-loving scene with tasty beer, grub and music is totally my style&&&&ambience+food
The live music is great and people are totally down to boogie&&&&ambience+food
The food is definitely southwestern comfort food&&&&ambience+food
Not a whole lot in the way of meatless fare,&&&&cost+food
I've only eaten here once&&&&food
The deep fried grilled cheese was, well&&&&food
Love me some shoestring fries and I could probably just have those for a whole meal&&&&food
The jalapeno mac n cheese was surprisingly spicy in a good way&&&&food
This spot is totally becoming a regular weekend hangout&&&&ambience
Taco tuesday is awesome&&&&ambience
It's a little off the beaten path in old town and the type of people that come here seem to be good people&&&&food
One of my favorite spots in Scottsdale both because of the service, tacos, Shiner, and the very cool look of the place&&&&ambience+food+service
You cannot get live honky tonk music like this anywhere close&&&&ambience
Did I say LIVE music? yes, I did&&&&ambience
We went there on a Saturday night, I guess the weekend it opened&&&&service
It is next to the Scottsdale Comedy Club, which by the way if you have not tried, must go&&&&food
they had a full bar, nice décor and great service&&&&ambience+food+service
the hush puppies lack flavor,&&&&food
again if you're drunk, anything fried is good&&&&food
The only criticism I can make is the place is small and it would have been nice if there was a patio to get away for some air&&&&ambience+food
I'd go back to enjoy the live music, drinks and try out their menu which is quite good in price&&&&ambience+cost+food
Great Venue, Good Food, Terrible Service&&&&food+service
We were completely ignored, waited forever to get our food order taken and I had to take up my soda to the bar to get a refill&&&&ambience+food+service
We were planning on going out to eat before getting to The Western,&&&&food
after hitting traffic we thought we'd play it safe and just eat at the venue&&&&food
00 we thought the doors would be open to serve food,&&&&food+service
when they say doors open and 7&&&&service
30, they open at 7&&&&service
30 rolled around and we were told the doors would be opening at 7&&&&service
45 instead&&&&food
45, doors didn't open&&&&service
00, doors didn't open&&&&service
15, 15 minutes after the show was suppose to start we got in and we grabbed one of the first tables we saw, right at the front near the stage&&&&ambience+food
A waitress came around and asked if we'd been helped, we said no and ordered a Coke (which was 90% ice) and PBR&&&&food+service
mentioned that we'd be ordering food tonight&&&&food+service
Then about a minute later another waitress came over and asked if we'd been helped, we said yes and assumed they a communication or organizational issue&&&&food
About 5 minutes later a bartender brought over our drinks and we started noticing food being brought out to the booths behind us&&&&ambience+food
We overheard the people behind us get asked if they wanted food to eat twice, yet our waitress walked right by us&&&&food
the opening band had already begun to play so it was difficult to get anyone's attention&&&&service
After being ready for 15 minutes, and watching everyone else get their food orders, our waitress came back and we finally got our order in&&&&food+service
we got the grilled cheese and a burger&&&&food
We got our food about 5 minutes later, which was okay, nothing special&&&&food
At that point we were so hungry would have been happy if they just brought us over some Taco Bell&&&&ambience
About halfway through the meal, we both ran out of drinks, down to the last drop of watered down Coke&&&&ambience+food
We began another round of find your waitress as our food got cold&&&&ambience+food
After about 5 minutes of trying I just gave up and walked over to the end of the bar with my empty glass&&&&ambience+food
Our waitress walked over to the bar and since the bartender was busy I asked her for another Coke and PBR&&&&ambience+food
She brought over our drinks and we finished our meal&&&&ambience+food
Then the fastest service we got was her bringing us the bill&&&&cost+food+service
Maybe we picked a bad table&&&&ambience
I definitely will be eating somewhere else beforehand&&&&food
Good brisket, quest, and burger&&&&food
The ambiance is very dark&&&&ambience
There is a good sound system and entertainment many nights&&&&ambience
There is a nice dance floor for when dancing is available&&&&food
most of the recorded music is certainly good for dancing county and western&&&&ambience
Like many others have said, great place to get away from the usual old town hustle&&&&food
Sunday's w/ Sara Robinson are awesome&&&&ambience
Most of their musicians are good and the staff has always been friendly&&&&ambience+service
So the doorman told me I missed a few songs of his set and right when I was about to pay, the woman running the show told him they're not taking any more money at the door&&&&ambience+cost
I guess they were closing the books or whatever - so I got in free&&&&ambience
Place was already packed to the gills with folks and there wasn't a whole lot of room to expand outward since there are mostly tables once you pass the main floorspace&&&&ambience
Sound was decent - it was just a duo with no drumkit so that would have been hard to mess up&&&&ambience
Can't complain because I didn't pay a cent for the whole experience and didn't even bother to get a drink&&&&cost+food
Managed to skip the openers and see just what I wanted&&&&service
Parking isn't too much of a problem even if it's crowded - you can keep driving E&&&&ambience
5th avenue until you see some open parking spots&&&&ambience+service
I found a space just before I hit Goldwater Blvd&&&&food
Great live music and atmosphere&&&&ambience+food
I would have liked to see 10 wings as opposed to 8, since the charge was equivalent to the burgers&&&&cost+food
For dessert we had the apple cobbler which was amazing&&&&food
I would definitely order that again&&&&service
The service was excellent&&&&food+service
All of the staff were very friendly and quick&&&&service
I wound up here after taking a life-threatening, drunken jaywalk across Indian School from The Valley Ho&&&&food
Needless to say, I made it safely across (and back) and had a GREAT time&&&&food
It's definitely one of the more genuine country places you'll find in The Valley and definitely at the top of my list for taking in some live music&&&&ambience
They pull off the rustic, country decor well and they have a country/chuck wagon inspired menu to boot&&&&ambience
I did not sample the food I just knocked back a few beers courtesy of the friendly, efficient bar staff who took good care of me and helped contri&&&&ambience+food+service
you'll find a more mature, well-behaved crowd and a more mellow environment more conducive to having fun than seeing and being seen&&&&ambience
This is equally good to come for drinks and eats as it is for drinking and tearing up the dance floor so I am looking forward to coming back soon and getting my two-step on---4&&&&food
Great food, good beers, fried oreos&&&&food
Had the wings and a burger this time&&&&food
Service was outstanding and if we were in the mood we would have stayed for the music that was setting up during dinner&&&&ambience+food+service
Great non-stereotypical Scottsdale scene for Scottsdale&&&&food
They had a country band playing on Wednesday and they were decent enough if you like that music&&&&ambience
It's like they undercharged me - strange&&&&cost
Tried the nachos and they were a fairly big portion loaded with ground beef and lots of black beans and sour cream&&&&ambience+food
The sauce was a cheese sauce, not real melted cheese&&&&food
Another gorgeous bartender was patrolling behind the bar as well&&&&ambience+food
Not crowded at happy Hour&&&&ambience
The Western is definitely worthy&&&&cost
Staff was friendly, prompt, and knew the menu&&&&service
The server (was quizzed)  had great recommendations&&&&food
and, and, the sound system for their performers is great&&&&ambience+food
It's off the beaten path,&&&&food
Food is lousy mainly because waitress does not listen&&&&food
Music is great&&&&ambience+food
eat elsewhere first&&&&food
Even trying to fix errors the food is only less&&&&food
Have not eaten in 9 hours so very hungry and still skipped much of it&&&&food
Need better wait staff and kitchen---1&&&&service
Situated in a hidden street just away from the hustle and bustle of Old Town, classy cowboys are welcomed into this new country establishment&&&&service
It's not your typical honky tonk bar though&&&&ambience
No here the lights are dim, the decor is country chic and the vibe is country classy&&&&ambience
I especially like the live bands they have and the dance floor that invites visitors to enjoy the music&&&&ambience
I have yet to try the food&&&&food
For not paying a cover, the band here was fantastic&&&&cost
The drinks were delicious and very reasonably priced&&&&cost+food
I noticed a small little section of the restaurant right off the dance floor that looked like it was reserved for a private party&&&&ambience+food+service
The service was also pretty fast and on top of things&&&&food+service
Don't go here for the food or the service&&&&food+service
If you like to drink and country music&&&&ambience+food
The food is mediocre and service really really slow&&&&food+service
It took an hour and a half for me to get a kale chicken caesar salad&&&&food
Thanks for telling me that when I placed my order from their menu with that salad on it&&&&food+service
And my sister's burger was suppose to have a fried egg on top&&&&food
When they served it they forgot to tell her they ran out of eggs&&&&food
They should just shut the kitchen down and serve drinks with the live bands&&&&food
The rest of the food in my group was bland and the manager comped the food because "they couldn't handle" business with another party of 75&&&&ambience+food+service
There are way too many fantastic places to eat in Scottsdale&&&&food
We don't need this lame excuse for food&&&&food
If they stay in business it will truly only be due to the music and drinks&&&&ambience+food

Do you know how hard that is to find in Old Town Scottsdale? 3&&&&food
They were really nice to my mom&&&&food
That gets kudos in my book&&&&ambience
All of the food was super fantastic - from the salmon to the all-your-fat-ass-can-eat-Sunday-special (which I got)&&&&food
My mom literally ate her entire salmon fillet, rice pilaf, corn husk, and licked the plate so hard I think she bore a hole in it&&&&ambience+food
I ate the pork&&&&food
t sliders + coleslaw + ribs + chicken + yes = happy Siobhan&&&&food
I randomly found this place through Groupon and I am very pleasantly surprised&&&&ambience
They have a sweet happy hour from 5pm to 7pm&&&&food

Sweet mother mary of jesus, YES, YES, YES&&&&food
Great live music with no cover&&&&ambience+food
The bar is awesome and made of textured leather, and they have some delicious mixed drinks if you are in the mood for something a little different&&&&ambience+food
Fried pickles and Ranch&&&&food
The food is delicious and the vibe is so laid back and welcoming&&&&food+service

I was also happy to hear that they were have great drink specials&&&&food
If you have ever dreamed of an heirloom tomato salad with chicken, it's from here&&&&ambience+food
I'm obsessed--I'm quietly pining for it now&&&&ambience
As far as live music goes, this place has two flavors&&&&ambience+food
I have only been here on the latter-type of night and it was always great&&&&food
Check ahead about the music if you're a snob either way&&&&ambience
Love the community tables, love the bison head, love the wallpaper, love the stage, love Eric the bartender, LOVE&&&&ambience+food
Deeds makes the best Butter Chicken in the world&&&&food
Find Flavor Chalet and try it, you will not be disappointed&&&&food
Flavor Chalet was one of the food tracks being served at the Capital Lawn&&&&food
I order a side of french fries and grilled cheese&&&&food+service
The large image behind the truck and his whiteboard suggested fresh thin cut fries&&&&ambience+food
But the fries he was setting up was from a frozen bag and they weren't thin cut at all, just large soft fries that he had to prepare the oil to deep fried them on&&&&food
He also took a long time just getting prepared to make my grilled cheese&&&&food
In short, he was very disorganized and at least 3 people who were waiting on him to take new orders, left&&&&service
He spend almost 10min working on my food, he didn't bother to take new orders&&&&food+service
The fries were bad as expected and the grilled cheese tasted funky&&&&food
He didn't used american sliced cheese,&&&&food
used shredded cheese&&&&food
He also used 2 regular size breads you get at Fry's&&&&food
For these two orders, I paid $12&&&&cost+service
In addition, his idea of curry meal on the whiteboard showed a large plate nicely prepared with the toppings&&&&ambience+food
I saw a guy ordering it and he got a small Styrofoam bowl with some premade curry served in it&&&&ambience+food+service
That cost him $6&&&&cost
Took a total of 20min to get my order&&&&service
Microwavable food&&&&food
Swindles you to pay for something that you didn't order&&&&cost+service
Avoid at all costs&&&&cost
This was the worst experience at a food truck ever&&&&food
All of the "Specials of the day" items that he had displayed on his white board were not available&&&&ambience
He heated up one last hamburger patty (not fresh) for my young daughter and put the patty on a stale hot dog bun&&&&ambience+food
No lettuce, no tomatoes, etc&&&&ambience+food
I asked for a plain bean & cheese burrito for my other young daughter and he put rice & curry in it&&&&food
what part of PLAIN beans & cheese did he not understand&&&&food
wanted to charge me FULL price for my order plus the burrito and hotdog hamburger&&&&ambience+cost+food+service
I told him that it was not a fair price and he was arguing with me about it- I will never eat here again and I will let many friends know about this experience&&&&ambience+cost+food
It's aiming for a fresh, Mediterranean feel as the owners are Italian&&&&ambience+food
Inside it's clean and light with a small number of tables and an impressive deli counter with fresh ingredients&&&&ambience+food
The service is friendly and the menu offers a good selection of cakes, sandwiches and Italian specialities like pizzas, calzones and pasta dishes&&&&food+service
I had a ham and pineapple pizza which only took about five minutes to be prepared and tasted amazing&&&&food
The base was nice and crisp and the topping was delicious with good quality cheese&&&&food
Not only was it tasty,&&&&food
it was filling too and only cost £4&&&&cost
It's a shame Elm Rose doesn't do more business as it offers friendly, quick service and great food at reasonable prices&&&&cost+food+service
The inside is small, with around 5 or 6 tables set out, each with a couple of chairs&&&&ambience
The right hand wall was occupied by a drinks chiller, with a chiller doubling as a counter at the back&&&&ambience+food
They serve the normal cafe range of items - drinks, small cakes, and no doubt paninis and sandwiches as well&&&&food
Staff greeted me with a smile, and though I only bought one small piece of cake, I would love to be able to go back and sample some more of their food&&&&food+service
Elm Rose, with its neat Rennie Mackintosh styling, offers good quality soup, sandwiches and other lunchtime treats&&&&ambience+food
It's well worth a visit, next time you're in the neighbourhood&&&&cost
There's much to be said for places that keep things smart and simple, and that's the category into which Elm Rose neatly fits&&&&ambience+food
) has the most tempting counter of food&&&&ambience+food
Situated on Elm Row, I would personally rather grab a bite here to go, or eat at home, as it is quite small&&&&food
the quality of the food can't be questioned&&&&food
The staff were extremely friendly, and a woman who worked there assured me there'd be a change of menu by the following week if she could be bothered&&&&service
I appreciate the numerous specials boards outside the cafe, as the food changes quite often and doesn't start to bore the customers&&&&ambience+food
They've got a clever lay out, as they offer ciabatas, baked potatoes, baguettes, wraps and rolls which can be finished off with any fillings you choose yourself from the counter&&&&ambience+food
The baked potato with chicken filling I had was really good, and to top it off, they are quite cheap as well&&&&ambience+cost+food
the staff(owners?) did not seem happy to see customers when the 5 of us walked in&&&&service
My chicken panini was all bread with almost no chicken except a few paper thin scraps&&&&food
Good place to grab a bite&&&&food
A colleague raved about their baked potatoe which I tried and was positively stuffed&&&&ambience+food
Had a Mexican wrap today, which came with salad and coleslaw&&&&food
Tasted great, would recommend as also have prompt service&&&&food+service
I found this lovely little café on route to a yoga class on a sunny Saturday morning, desperate for some caffeine and a minimal breakfast which would complain if I spent lots of time bending over and touching my toes&&&&ambience+cost
There is a well stacked bookshelf in the corner by the counter, and a world map on the wall by the door with a request to 'pin where you've travelled'&&&&ambience
It has a few tables&&&&ambience
ended up with an Americano and some yoghurt coated raisins which were very satisfactory&&&&food
The menu was vast though, featuring a variety of hot and cold snacks, and even Turkish coffee&&&&ambience+food
They have a few small tables and plenty of sandwiches, salads and soups to choose from&&&&ambience+food
I liked the buffalo chicken wraps, the falafel and the soups&&&&food
I found myself going back there a few times when I was staying in Edinburgh recently because the owners were friendly and the food was very good and freshly made&&&&ambience+food+service
I stopped here to meet a friend for a quick coffee and cake session, and I was surprised to see it because I have passed the place loads of times and just never noticed it&&&&food
This is a wee traditional caff, selling lunch food like paninis, toasties and a selection of hot meals&&&&ambience+food
The cakes were superb- my scone with jam and cream was divine coupled with a cup of milky tea- heaven or what?It was a cute and comfortable place to sit, and even though it was small we never felt rushed to leave&&&&ambience+food
The food is the usual fast food&&&&food
I always go since it's close and the service were good&&&&food+service
However, it all changed when they changed the manager from the older male manager to a new small female asian manager&&&&service
The old manager is very patient and very chatty and friendly&&&&service
this new manager is very impatient and rude to customers&&&&service
I was there to order the new grilled bagel and she at first mistaken that I wanted a bagel&&&&food+service
When I cleared it up so that she has to make a modification on the order, everyone can hear her muttering "oh god&&&&ambience+service
Then I specifically asked for a combo and when she gave me the food, there is no hush brown&&&&food
When I ask her about it, she just said annoyingly that she did not charge me and walked away&&&&cost
As a client, I can accept mistakes in the order as long as everything is clarified, either make the order right and charge me for the difference or apologize and let me know there isn't much she can do about it&&&&cost+service
However, her behavior is not setting a good example to the other employees and I sincerely hope that they change the manager for this store&&&&service
Terrible service&&&&food+service
The French fries were the worst I have ever eaten&&&&food
Coffee is good and hot though&&&&ambience+food
I usually come here before work on weekends and pick up a hot chocolate and a crate of TimBits&&&&ambience+cost+food
Service is a little slow, and they never have enough Timbits ti fill out my box, they only have the "leftovers" of the jelly filled once, which I try and avoid&&&&food+service
They lack donut selection, like there is not enough, or they are already out of stock at 8am&&&&food
I grab and go, its cheap and good, just missing the selection&&&&cost+food
If I had to complain, I would say that they pack the place a little too tight with the tables&&&&ambience
inexpensive doesn't have to mean gross&&&&service
that place hasn't been cleaned in ages, the baskets hanging from the ceiling are so dustry, it makes me want to vomit&&&&ambience
the food is diner-quality and their cooked apples are gross (plus i hate cooked apples)&&&&food
it's small and stuffy and reminds me of a dirty grandmother's house&&&&ambience
the only reason they're still open is because Montreal has loads of cheapos&&&&cost+service
Great place for brunch, very intimate seating&&&&ambience+food+service
Great meals with clearly very fresh ingredients&&&&ambience+food
A gem of Plateau&&&&ambience+food
The food's pretty good, and there are lots of options, although it has a bit of that all-tasting-the-same problem that sometimes happens at brunch places&&&&food
feel kind of crowded when you're eating&&&&ambience+food
On se demande toujours pourquoi les gens aiment faire la ligne le samedi matin à seule fin de se faire servir des oeufs-bacon, avec une tranche de melon et deux rondelles de banane&&&&ambience+food
J'aime beaucoup, personnellement, les röstis, galettes de pommes de terre rapées, agrémentées de fromage, d'olive, de tomate, de bacon, ou autre selon celle que l'on choisit&&&&ambience+food
Ils font aussi d'excellentes pancakes à l'avoine&&&&food
Pourquoi pas une étoile de plus alors ?Parce qu'ils ne savent pas faire un expresso convenable (et c'est vraiment le MOINS qu'on puisse dire)&&&&ambience+food
On m'a expliqué que c'était le plus court que la machine pouvait faire&&&&ambience
Mais tout de même, pour un resto à déjeuner, ne pas pouvoir faire un café décent&&&&ambience
They have a lot a choices and it's inexpensive&&&&food
The place is very cute and decorated like a farm&&&&ambience+cost+food
I had eggs florentine on english muffins and smoked salmon with a hollandaise sauce&&&&food
It comes with hash-brown potatoes and sweet & warm apples&&&&ambience+food
The bill was less than $12&&&&cost
Le service, l'ambiance, la deco&&&&food+service
(we finally got there at night by driving lol) We're walking around Plateau Mont Royal's main road and just went in out of hunger and exhaustion&&&&ambience+food
Great bread as a side and the satisfying quantity can feed Americans&&&&food
lol Servers were speaking fairly good English so don't be afraid to join locals of Montreal +_+&&&&ambience
Well if you need coffee, its as you would expect at Tims&&&&food
The line up is always big and the service is very slow for a Tims&&&&food+service
Despite a renovation to update the appearance they still can't get your order right&&&&food+service
Tonight I ordered two teas at the drive thru and when I got home it turned out they were both coffee despite being labeled as tea&&&&food+service
Often this location is out of the item you want and take way too long to put your order together especially compared to many other Tim Horton's locations nearby&&&&service
Super friendly staff&&&&service
Unique selection of donuts that you wont always find at other locations&&&&food
By the way if you're going to come here to meet with someone, make sure that you order something&&&&service
They actually keep up on people sitting around and whether they are ordering stuff&&&&service
This location keeps tabs on people because it certain times of the day there are a lot of young whippersnappers hanging out and not ordering&&&&service
Lovely vegetarian cafe that serves good big portions of wholesome meals&&&&food
If you can't decide what to have at the counter, you can pick and mix, having 2 half portions of main courses for instance, or a main course and a couple of salads&&&&ambience+food
There is a noticeboard, and often artists exhibit on the walls&&&&ambience+food
'Susie's' est un resto très informelle avec plein de nourriture végétariénne, bio, commerce équitable etc&&&&ambience
Très populaire avec les étudiants d'Edimbourg&&&&ambience
Susie's Diner is somewhere to go when you've indulged beyond the pale and your body is suffering physical guilt and demanding some healthy comfort&&&&ambience+food
Generous portions of delicious vegetarian fare are the order of the day&&&&cost+food+service
They have a system where you can choose various configurations of salads, quiches and hot dishes for set prices in a canteen-esque set up&&&&ambience+cost+food
Prices are generally around £3-£7&&&&cost+food
The mix 'n' match crockery together with the self-service food and drink give Susie's a very informal feeling and the casual décor of red painted walls, unvarnished tables and wooden benches all contri&&&&ambience+food+service
Feel-good food in a family friendly diner devoid of any pretension&&&&food+service
Located conveniently near george Square campus, this small albeit popular restaurant/cafe has a winning combination of great food, generous portions, good service and reasonable price ( also as a bonus, the 'guilt free' satisfaction of having eaten a vegetarian and organic meal)&&&&cost+food+service
Desserts and cakes are to die for&&&&food
The atmosphere is relaxed and the staff is all smiles and you can linger over a meal and a conversation with a friend&&&&service
20pounds I got a small plate with one portion of hot food and some rice&&&&ambience+food
No salad or anything&&&&food
The service was also rude and abrupt&&&&food+service
I will say that the food was delicious (I made my small portion last as long as possible)&&&&food
next time I would go to the mosque kitchen next door and get a much larger meal for less without the dramatic service&&&&ambience+food+service
This place is where you will go when you are craving some home cooked food and cant get any&&&&food
The food is standard home cooked meal types cooked very well&&&&food
The servings are very generous which most will appreciate, although if some aren't too hungry it may be worth sharing&&&&cost+service
Susie's serves exclusively vegetarian food&&&&food
The atmosphere and ordering procedure is a little too student to make the night of it more canteen than restaurant&&&&service
However, the food is always great and there are plenty of pubs around for after&&&&food
You can find quick and tasty vegetarians options here&&&&food
I ate here several times while traveling alone in Edinburgh and felt very comfortable eating alone (not always the case at other places)&&&&ambience+food
I hope my 4 star rating isn't too generous&&&&service
Service is also lacklustre at times&&&&food+service
I really did enjoy the food when it was "on"&&&&food
I had the baked tortillas with goat cheese and shrimp, extremely tasty&&&&food
The service was friend, informative and really fast&&&&ambience+food+service
The food was prepared quickly and well presented&&&&food
Try the lime margaritas&&&&food
Courteous service&&&&food+service
the food is terrible&&&&food
I ordered the burrito which was cold and came with no noticeable cheese&&&&ambience+food+service
Beef stuffing was dry and the only flavour I tasted was salt&&&&food
- Very tasty, simple food&&&&food
- Reasonably priced, especially given the location&&&&cost+food
- Friendly, fast service&&&&food+service
- No vegetarian option for main dishes&&&&food
Vegetarian entrées were available and I was told that the burrito's meat/chicken could be swapped for grilled vegetables at the same price&&&&ambience+cost+food
Also, grilled vegetables are not a proper vegetarian choice in 2015, especially in a restaurant that features beans and cheese in so many other dishes&&&&ambience+food
Every table outdoors is adorned with a centerpiece of three beers (not included, just to be clear)&&&&ambience
The first two pages of the food menu are actually a drink menu&&&&food
When we were ready to order, with closed menus, our waitress reopened my menu to the drink pages and went on at great length about what was available&&&&food+service
I understand that restaurants need to sell alcohol to increase the average check price,&&&&cost+food
Good service, horrible food&&&&food+service
It came cold, and when i complained my food was cold (fridge cold) i was told its normal in a busy restaurant to cook all the food early in the morning and&&&&ambience+food
reheat it for service&&&&food+service
I respectfully declined that dish and paid for our appetizers and walked away&&&&cost
I realize how pretentious it is to review an airport Quiznos&&&&ambience
However, this $9 salad I just gave up on is particularly bad&&&&food
The tomatoes also taste like rancid little iced cubes&&&&ambience+food
However, I saw someone eating a sandwhich and was hungry so I asked the person how was it? They had an Italian sandwhich and said it was good&&&&food
I decided to go ahead and buy it because there weren't that many choices&&&&food
This could have been great or at the very least good,&&&&food
The sandwhich after having gone through the "toaster" was cold literally within 30 seconds&&&&ambience+food
The taste was not great&&&&food
There are only three places to eat and quiznos could easily be the spot to eat&&&&ambience+food
I paid $9 for a steak sandwich that had no steak&&&&cost+food
One paper thin slice of meat on one half of the foot long sub was all i got and everything is supposedly prepared ahead of time so they wont/cant fix it&&&&food
And the actual bread was salty&&&&food
way too salty&&&&food
and the sauce that came with it tastes like it was rancid&&&&food
The whole thing was inedible&&&&food
it's the airport&&&&ambience
Average Turkish/Middle Eastern cuisine place for kebabs&&&&food
The food prep time is atrocious (almost 30 mins) and the food isn't extraordinary&&&&food
I ordered the sandwich with lamb sandwich combo with salad and a soda&&&&food+service
The portion of salad is generous&&&&food+service
I can't finish the sandwich so I tried to pick the meat out of the bread and I found a suspicious hair probably a eyelash&&&&ambience+food
The worst part was that the owner wouldn't give us the receipt and charged five dollar more than what we should pay&&&&cost
I even asked did he include the tips in the bill&&&&cost
After he ""realized" he charged more&&&&cost
He said he thought we order one more soda&&&&food+service
What soda worth 5 dollars? That's totally a lie&&&&cost+food
He is not a honest man and he acted like it was our fault not telling him we took only two soda&&&&food
tic Turkish food it's like you have no choice&&&&food
to go here hoping that you'll get lucky and eat something  decent,&&&&food
unfortunately you can't eat anything good here&&&&food
First they don't know how to make doner , bulgur pilav is sooooo dry have absolutely no taste ,let's talk about so called Adana kebab now that's a total joke it's just a minced meat filled with cheap quality red pepper to make it spicy and hoping that it becomes what is supposed to be&&&&cost+food
with what kind of customers? Definitely majority of there customers don't have Turkish or let's say Armenian backgrounds , they cater to low budget middle eastern immigrants most of them from 3rd world country's where they don't have any idea what Turkish food is&&&&food
People who reads our reviews will see that so far we don't have 1 good review about Turkish restaurants in Ontario and Quebec , that's because we travel to Istanbul 4 to 6 times a year and we really know what Turkish kebab is  unfortunately there is not one decent Turkish kebab restaurant specially in Quebec&&&&food
Place looks like a old Middleastern mosque with all green walls , and the music that you hear while you eat? Omg in Turkish we say (AGIT) meaning? Sad crying song when someone dies this is the kind of music they listen at uncivilized Turkish villages&&&&ambience+food+service
Before I forget Shepard salad , ezme are sitting on the counter( not in the fridge) yes on the counter covered with Saran Wrap so it does not get dirty , you have to eat warm Shepard salad that's unfortunate&&&&ambience+food
))))) Is the place clean yes it is&&&&ambience
again that does not make the food good, Iam hoping 1 day In Montreal we will have a good Turkish kebab restaurants like Toronto or New York&&&&food
I had the mixed meat plate, which consisted of chicken, lamb and meatball kebab and some salads on the side&&&&ambience+food
One plate was plenty for two people&&&&ambience
all in all, the kebabs are alright, not bad for turkish/middle eastern kebabs,&&&&food
not quite worth coming all the way to NDG for either&&&&cost
The price was reasonable, around $14 for the large plate, which can be shared generously among two people&&&&ambience+cost+food+service
Waited 20 minutes for two Chicken Kebab Sandwich for take out, and I was the only customer during dinner service&&&&food+service
The sandwich was extremely bland, with barely any seasoning, or lack thereof&&&&ambience
One more thing, the guy who was preparing my sandwich did not wash the lettuce I saw him chopped and he did not wash his hands after handling raw meat either&&&&food
I won't go as far as recommending McDonald's instead of this place,&&&&food
Subway is definitely a wiser choice&&&&food
My friend was raving about this, saying it's as good as Antep (as if)I took the mixed plate, very little meat and was still hungry&&&&ambience+food
No rice, just some salad and a bulgur type of side&&&&food
Bread was good,&&&&food
meat felt re-heated&&&&food
Went twice, the first and the last&&&&food
If it wasn't for the amount of time you must wait until your friggin sandwich gets prepared (between 20-25 minutes&&&&cost+food
Although one can quip about their mediocre decor or lack thereof, I can only talk positive about the bread they use which is ok, not too fluffy and slightly crispy after it's grilled&&&&ambience+food
Oh and they change their menu prices quite often and I once got charged the older higher price when it was time to pay&&&&cost+food
Nice Decor, mediocre food&&&&ambience+food
Dropped by for all you can eat (AYCE) lunch&&&&food
Now for that price, don't order any raw fish dishes&&&&cost+food+service
It won't be 'jumped out of the water' fresh&&&&ambience+food
The soups were good - a bit starchy&&&&food
the hot and sour tasted fine&&&&ambience+food
Thai mango salad - skip&&&&food
The mango was nice&&&&food
the sauce was awkward&&&&food
I would highly recommend the teriaki chicken&&&&food
I found their grilled dishes to be piping hot and crisp&&&&ambience+food
The service was quite attentive&&&&food+service
you had better keep track of what you ordered&&&&service
Hence why I can't comment on the dim sum, it never arrived&&&&ambience
Actually, service is worst, you order something and they bring it partly and slow&&&&food+service
While having all you can eat menu, even you order more they don't bring it to you and they have no explanation for it&&&&food+service
right now service is too careless&&&&food+service
Lovely restaurant and lots of great options to choose from&&&&food
The servers were great and the atmosphere was lovely&&&&food
Drinks are reasonably priced, too&&&&cost+food
The sushi was okay- not top bar&&&&ambience
Great place&&&&food
Lunch all you can eat for 12&&&&food
Can't go wrong with the Malay rice and noodle dishes&&&&food
Good service&&&&food+service
They've removed the all you can eat&&&&food
not worth it now&&&&cost
For all you can eat this is very good&&&&food
99 for lunch and it's all you can eat sushi, thai, Chinese and some Dim Sum&&&&ambience+food
For the sushi I would recommend the fiery dragon which is dragon roll with a nice sauce on top&&&&food
Thai pad thai and hot and spicy chicken are nice too&&&&ambience+food
The mango salad and the dim sum were only ok&&&&ambience+food
for the price it's DEF worth it&&&&cost+food
extra $1 for soft drinks with free refills (good deal)&&&&food
The food wasn't bad,&&&&food
the chicken wasn't fresh, there was a weird taste to it&&&&ambience+food
Service was bad though&&&&food+service
Solo diners get ignored&&&&service
That I can deal with since I have been to a lot of Asian restaurants in the past with no service&&&&food+service
But this was worse because the manager was actually quite rude&&&&service
And I got the impression that he is trying to control how much you order&&&&service
I might stay away until service improves&&&&food+service
SKIP the dim sum and go for the sushi instead&&&&ambience+food
That and it's name doesn't seem that prominent, I thought Hot and Spicy was the description&&&&ambience+food
it looks pretty fancy inside, kinda shiny, and the waiters and waitresses use littler ipad things to take your order&&&&ambience+service
But they were quite friendly, I guess they should be since it was only us and one or 2 people getting take out&&&&service
My friend got the mango chicken, and I ordered a lunch special of grilled teriyaki salmon&&&&food+service
The special was great, it came with a really good hot and sour soup, some dark organic rice and your typical kind of salad&&&&ambience+food
The mango chicken was good&&&&food
And it costed about $5 more since it wasn't a special&&&&cost
I think overall the regular menu is a little pricey for me compared to other things nearby&&&&cost+food
And the service was a-ok&&&&food+service
Just came back from the AYCE Lunch & gonna write & rate as I can still remember it&&&&cost
Miso Soup (3&&&&food

- We were able to get a seat when we arrived at 1&&&&food
00 Bottomless pop soooo good, not watered down at all&&&&food
Nice atmosphere to sit in&&&&food
- Service was quick & *SUPER* friendlyCONS&&&&food+service
- Dim sum items weren't that great - its like they needed more salt&&&&ambience+food
- Didn't have the wonton soup when I ordered it, so I went for Hot & Sour instead&&&&ambience+food+service
- The food here is kind of like Manchu Wok/Szechuan-Szechuan type food, with the addition of Sushi though  - Even though it says on the menu they will charge $2&&&&cost+food
00 for each item not consumed, they didn't charge us, even though we had about 3 half-dishes of uneaten items left&&&&ambience+cost+food
, you don't wanna be facing west cause the sun will be shining in your face&&&&ambience
=)  The food could use some work though&&&&food
We ordered a soup and a noodle dish&&&&food+service
The noodle dish arrived and was placed on my side of the table&&&&ambience
The soup never arrived&&&&food
When we  asked about it the waiter said we only talked about the soup&&&&food+service
didn't order it&&&&service
Lesson learned repeat the order or ask the waiter to repeat the order&&&&food+service
Went down the street to Ginger to finish the meal&&&&food
today, the service was confused and slow&&&&food+service
The food was ok&&&&food
There are better choices in the neighbourhood&&&&food
They were slow taking my order, 10 minutes later another waiter brought me another menu&&&&ambience+food+service
Kung Pow Chicken was ok and&&&&food
it took some effort to get my bill&&&&cost
The restaurant was empty so we were excited to have dedicated service&&&&food+service
Decor is modern and appears fairly clean&&&&ambience+food
Very slow and incompetent service, despite being one of the only families at the restaurant&&&&food+service
They kept getting our order wrong and bringing out duplicate dishes&&&&service
An hour in to dinner we still did not receive our sushi and had to place our order again2&&&&service
"Cooked" dim sum dishes coming to the table rawWould not come back and would not recommend&&&&ambience+food
Been at this spot a few times so I wanted to give it a few takes prior to giving it a fair review&&&&ambience
The food is very bland&&&&food
Any request for spicy food results in them tossing in chili flakes&&&&food
At Salad King they use fresh peppers&&&&ambience+food
When I was in Thailand, they use fresh peppers&&&&ambience+food
The peppers should be infused in the meal&&&&food
Service?  I have only gone through take out, 3 times&&&&ambience+food+service
I had to go back and forth from my office to the restaurant since they messed up my order twice&&&&food+service
THREE trips to that location for 1 order is unacceptable&&&&ambience+service
The manager I met a few weeks back is super friendly&&&&service
Worst food and service I have received in a long long time&&&&food+service
Got all you can eat&&&&food
Our second round of order got lost somehow&&&&service
Waited almost 30 mins for the food to come&&&&food
The manager was extremely rude&&&&service
That manager should be fired yesterday, if he even cared&&&&service
Had the all you can eat and it really surprised at the variety of food offered&&&&food
Salmon carpaccio is definitely worth trying as well as the thai basiil eggplant&&&&cost+food
don't expect service&&&&food+service
they are friendly&&&&service
The food is great and I am ready to tackle the AYCE&&&&food
Might go there today with my family if it's open for Xmas&&&&service
dish is the sweet and sour fish&&&&food
Dropped by for dinner before a movie at Scotiatheatre&&&&food
Should have walked a few extra steps to the more well known and well rated places&&&&cost
Dinner is not all you can eat,&&&&food
Besides the green tea, nothing was ok&&&&food
Hot and sour soup was commercial and average (probably better than anything else we ate)&&&&ambience+food
Chicken in black bean sauce was so bland and bad (even though we asked for spicy)&&&&food
Fried rice was meh&&&&food
Sui mai and har gow were glutinous and barely had flavour&&&&ambience
Just looks clean and neat and spacious&&&&ambience+food
Walk a few extra steps to Queen Mother or even Ginger&&&&food
Or Trimurti Indian food across the road&&&&food
so going out to eat was a big deal&&&&food
My memories of it when being a child were all of people that I was with, and not the food, and now I think I know why&&&&food
If the food was as bland back&&&&food
I have dined at this Country Kitchen on several occaisions after movies at the UltraStar Theater (they should drop the Ultra&&&&food
)  and I have brought my family here several times for breakfast or quick lunches etc&&&&ambience
Country Kitchen is a lateral move from Dennys and IHOP, with a slightly better focus on service however given the area I know that service will be the first thing to go&&&&ambience+food+service
When the have-nots barely speak english and disrepect the community it shows and it takes it's toll on the service people&&&&ambience+food+service
It is a bit pricey for what you get&&&&cost+food
So if you must eat here, bring a coupon or the bill will somewhat infuriate you due to the wholly unexceptional food&&&&cost+food
Without a coupon expect to pay 15-20% more than a Dennys or Village Inn for about the same food&&&&cost+food
On the bright side, I have had lunch here several times and really enjoyed the Reuben, so there is at least one sandwich that has some flavor and was not a dissapointment&&&&food
So there we have it, if you are dragged here to eat, get a Reuben&&&&food
We get takeout from CK every month or so, and it's pretty solid 'American' food&&&&food
At the same time, if you are looking for 'wild and exciting' at a place called Country Kitchen, you're probably going to be disappointed no matter what&&&&ambience
I almost gave them 4 stars based on their seasonal breadbowl soups&&&&ambience+food
try the pot roast soup, that was our favorite&&&&ambience+food
not because they have awesome food&&&&ambience+food
Nick's offered a "buy one get one free" coupon on the back of Fry's grocery store receipts so me and my girlfriend took advantage of that quite a few times until they stopped the promotion&&&&food
The unfortunate thing about Nick's is the pictures of the food in the menu are great, what you get served looks nothing like it&&&&food
The food is average at best, me and my girlfriend joked that we wouldn't come back if it weren't for the BOGO deal they were offering&&&&food
The restaurant looks nice, it's clean&&&&ambience+food
The hostess and wait staff are all very friendly&&&&service
The food quality and chef expertise is lacking horribly&&&&food
This manager is a chauvinist pig, he has fired me because he has gotten a complaint on himself, he has made sexual comments to almost everyone that works there and is a very rude person&&&&service
it's a 'honey & y'all' accent&&&&food
D She had a very friendly disposition & made our lunch experience a pleasure&&&&ambience+service
The food was decent AND you can have breakfast all day&&&&food
)The building is fairly new, not too brightly lit & clean&&&&ambience
I've been eating at this CK since they opened&&&&food+service
I probably go once or twice a month for breakfast, and occasionally for lunch / dinner&&&&food
They've changed managers several times, and can never seem to get a good one&&&&service
I have no met the current one, I just noticed that the last one I met is no longer there&&&&food
The waitresses are usually great&&&&food
The breakfast food is pretty standard&&&&food
Pancakes, waffles, omelets, and all the usual breakfast meats&&&&food
Their burgers are decent,&&&&food
Their all you can eat rib or fish & chips nights are a pretty good deal,&&&&food
I'm not really impressed by their dinner food&&&&food
However, I've never had anything that wasn't good enough for me to eat till I'm full&&&&food
As the mom of  2 kids (a 3 year old and a 8 month old) it seems to be very difficult to find a nice place to eat that is very comfortable and casual- and somewhere that people don't give you evil looks and comments  for bringing kids (Carraba's)&&&&ambience+food
We have been here a few times for lunch and the food has always been good&&&&food
Not great,&&&&food
I will say though that their french fries are some of the best I've had&&&&food
Despite Christine S and her stellar review, I'd have to say "Surprise you can do better" I've eaten country kitchen 3 times at time of this review, the food is nothing denny's IHOP or village inn don't offer, I'm a bit of a sucker for fish fry's so the one time we actually dined in, I had the fish fry and it's not bad,&&&&food
we've gotten their breakfast to go on a lazy weekend morning, the pancakes are decent, however my breakfast seemed to be kind of sparse on meat, the other night we got back from happy hour and appetizers with some coworkers of mine and we were still hungry, not feeling like fast food we call up country kitchen and order an order of their sliders and 2 milkshakes&&&&food+service
so I wait about 10-15 minutes, leave my house which is about 2 mi away, arrive at the restaurant to find it completely barren at about 7&&&&ambience+food
30PM, I approach the counter and the manager just continues to mess with his blackberry never looking up eventually, a hostess comes from the back and greets me, mind you it's already been 15 minutes and all they need to do was grill some small beef pattys and drop some fries, I still end up waiting another 10 minutes for my food, only to have everyone disappear into the back of the restaurant again to have another server come out confused and try to seat me&&&&ambience+food+service
eventually I get the food, the sliders aren't bad,&&&&food
3 sliders could potentially cause a rift in some relationships, the decor is an orgy of applebees, IHOP and denny's&&&&ambience+food
imagine if you arrived  at the "campy wall crap" store only to find they'd already been cleaned out by an applebees corporate decorator, the decorations range from giant utensils, wireframe art, sports posters and scenic views&&&&ambience+cost+food
unfortunately Country Kitchen is the closest full service restaurant to my home so I will probably end up back here some lazy saturday morning picking up eggs and pancakes&&&&food+service
I was excited to see Surprise Pointe being built and to see more services coming closer to me, so far I've only seen more of the same&&&&food+service
This was a great place to stop and eat breakfast&&&&food
I enjoyed the fact that we were seated quickly and that they had the games on the TV&&&&food
It felt like I was at home eating breakfast&&&&food
I was in the mood for something with cheese and eggs,&&&&food
not an omelet, so I ordered the Skillet Scramble with a side of toast&&&&service
Taste was great and the portion size was plenty (I did not finish it)&&&&food
Overpriced and boring&&&&cost+food
There is nothing overly creative or unique about any of their menu offerings&&&&food
Very limited menu, especially for healthier or vegetarian options&&&&food
Don't be fooled by their claim to "the best pancakes in town"&&&&food
according to their website, 5 new Country Kitchen franchises are due to open in the Phoenix area&&&&service
Food quality and selection is at the Denny's quality&&&&food
Service was decent and food quality was decent&&&&food+service
Most of the food is good, sometimes the fish portion sizes vary, once my husband ordered it and it was huge the next time is was like 3 times smaller&&&&food+service
Service varies it just depends on who you get&&&&food+service
Also the assistant night manager is rude&&&&service
We took our 4 kids out to dinner since it was my daughters 10th birthday and was refused service since it was close to closing time&&&&food+service
56 pm and the sign on the window said they closed @9&&&&service
Was told they channged the hours to close at 8 so we could not be served even though we were already in the restaurant ready to be seated&&&&food
Quite good for simple food&&&&food
My wife and I have been to the Country Kitchen twice now and we have really enjoyed it&&&&food
Very attentive and friendly&&&&service
On to the food&&&&food
On my first visit I had the blue cheese burger with fries&&&&food
the Burger was very juicy and tender topped with a good quality blue cheese&&&&food
The fries were crispy and you could actually taste potato, not salt and grease&&&&ambience+food
On our second trip my wife and I started with the loaded potato skins with a side of ranch&&&&ambience+food
The server brought it out because we had asked to have a side of it with our burger to dip there oh so yummy onion rings in&&&&ambience+food
) The potato skins had to be some of the best we have had&&&&ambience+food
they were piled with there four cheese blend and crisp bacon&&&&food
My wife and I split the big BBQ bacon burger with onion rings and it did not disappoint&&&&food
The brought it out already cut and on two separate plates with an equal amount of onion rings on each&&&&ambience+cost+food
The burger was juicy and the BBQ sauce did not over power the beef&&&&food
The service was stellar and the food was good&&&&food+service
So stop on in and enjoy great service and good food&&&&food+service
I think this is a great neighborhood place to grab a meal&&&&food
The service is always professional & friendly&&&&food+service
Other people have compared this place to Denny's and in my opinion it's a much nicer dining experience&&&&food
First of all it's open and not all cramped and it's CLEAN&&&&ambience+service
The food is good, a nice variety on the menu&&&&food
This establishment is a great addition to the neighborhood&&&&food
This place is great for breakfast and however many cups of coffee the help remember to fill&&&&ambience+food
I overheard an argument between a customer and the manager about a brown steak&&&&food+service
Have an alibi ready in case you run into any problems with your order&&&&service
I wanted to look at the food before agreeing to sit down and at first glance it looked pretty decent compared to other chinese buffets I've been to&&&&food
But if I can offer one piece of advice, dont go there on Fridays for lunch&&&&food
apparently every Friday morning they host the local nut house for a meal&&&&food
Don't get me wrong, it's a nice gesture&&&&food
There were at least 50 people from the rehab center inside the restaurant trying to get food from the substandard buffet&&&&food
I should have also noticed something was "up" when I saw all the rehab vans parked in the parking lot&&&&food
But trying to keep an open mind, we continued to sit down and tried to eat our meal&&&&food+service
Besides all that, the food was not super hot and was pretty gross and NOT cheap&&&&ambience+cost+food
I would NOT recommend this place for it's food and especially not on Fridays if you don't want to get assaulted by a local mental patient&&&&food
We have been going here for years, I mean lots of years for the crab legs, mostly because they brought them out at  a reasonable pace which is to say not slowly&&&&ambience+food+service
As of a few months ago if they felt someone was eating too many they started slowing down or deliberately bringing out "skunky" legs, the ones that taste real fishy and aren't really all that well cooked&&&&cost+food
On a recent visit the owner, a Chinese man in his late 40's or 50's actually yelled at a customer at length in Chinese  for eating too many crab legs&&&&food
I have never seen such rudeness and we won't go back again, the food is a C-, the attitude is an F&&&&food+service
If a restaurant wants to be reviewed on more than the quality of its bathroom, its food shouldn't keep the entire party imprisoned there&&&&ambience+food
Despite wonderful service, a good price ($10 for dinner), a lot of premium dishes, and fresh sushi, the overall experience was awful&&&&ambience+cost+food+service
My whole table took turns rotating through the disgusting bathroom&&&&ambience
I think the biggest problem was that the food was kept at room temperature&&&&food
he didn't seem to notice that everything was tepid&&&&food
The food also ruined the after-dinner movie, which effectively doubled the cost of our loss&&&&cost+food
I've been going here steadily for the last 10 years and it's by far the best chinese buffet in the valley&&&&food
They've got tons of fresh sushi and any kind of food you want&&&&ambience+food
The spicy chicken and sweet shrimp are my favorites&&&&food
Yea I know most buffet's are ronchy, the food is actually pretty good here&&&&food
They have fresh sushi, crab legs, and plenty of shrimp&&&&ambience+food
The bathroom stinks,&&&&ambience
the food is good&&&&food
The place had faint wet-rag sort of smell to it,&&&&ambience
it could have been that our booth seats were wiped with a wet rag right before as the seats were still glistening with water&&&&ambience+food
The food is what it is and what you would expect, Nothing spectacular&&&&food
They have the orange chicken, beef broccoli, spring rolls, and all those type of dishes, however not as assembly line and generic tasting as the Panda Express chains&&&&food
One of the chicken dishes had chicken that tasted like the chicken was old or left out too long&&&&food
The bill for two of us dining including drinks(iced tea)was under $22&&&&cost+food
Definitely cheap, however not worth more&&&&cost
The bottom line is if you are looking for a Americanized Chinese for cheap,&&&&cost
Nothing was really bad (except the Lo Mein noodles that tasted like they cooked in a burnt pan) and nothing really stood out as being really good&&&&food
I guess they recently did the flooring, and I found it to be very slippery, not good when you're carrying plates of food&&&&ambience+food
I did find most of the appetizer stuff, like crab rangoon and pot stickers were a little too greasy&&&&ambience+food
The fried and breaded shrimp was tasty and I did like their style of egg foo yung&&&&food
The staff barely spoke English and when Mike asked what something on his plate was, our waiter thought he was asking for more and brought them to him&&&&ambience+service
The service was attentive,&&&&food+service
From the vending machines in the entryway selling gun and lowrider stickers, to the white plastic menu board hung partially askew, to the cheap-ass jewelry on sale laying out on top of the cash register desk, to the toothpick wrappers and various other little pieces of garbage on the floor in the foyer, to the fish pond with a single sad (possibly dead) koi, just about everything in the place screams "We really don't give a crap"&&&&ambience+cost+food
? Why not one?Because the food was actually not&&&&food
Still, if you're after Chinese buffet, try the one at 15th Av and Bethany instead&&&&food
we were quickly seated&&&&food
I'll be beating him later,&&&&food
The food was pretty marginal overall&&&&food
It was definitely NOT hot enough&&&&ambience+food
Replicator food on the Enterprise is better than this&&&&food
Want to piss me off?  Serve me tepid food and&&&&food
charge me $8 cubits a head for same&&&&cost
I almost think there were too many choices&&&&food
I'd like to see the choices narrowed, the temperature increased and the food quality improved&&&&food
As for eating sushi in a place like this?  No way in Hades&&&&food
Overall, C-There has to be better choices for buffet Chinese food in central Phoenix, and I'm on a mission to find it&&&&food
We must find a suitable class-M Chinese food planet in this sector&&&&ambience+food
It's cheap & there are lots of options food wise&&&&cost+food
That's a major plus in my book&&&&ambience
Everyone seems to go for the crab,&&&&food
If you want crab I suggest sitting where you can watch them put it out&&&&food
t to grab choice pieces before everyone else&&&&food
Keep in mind the people seating you barely speak English&&&&ambience+food
There's always a language barrier&&&&ambience
They're really only there to clear plates away&&&&ambience
the food is good & replaced often enough&&&&food
If decor is important to you don't come here&&&&ambience
If you just want to chow down on all sorts of cheap food goodness&&&&cost+food
The food here is pretty good i do not think i tried anything that was not at least average with most dishes above average&&&&food
they had a couple of different items as well ,mexican chicken wings that tasted like they were cooked with oranges and shrimp balls that were pretty good&&&&food
Their quality can waver, probably as much by time spent on the steam tables as any other reason&&&&ambience+food
Their fried shrimp, hot and sour soup are generally very good&&&&ambience+food
the steam table is capable of making it uneditable&&&&ambience+food
when not destroyed on the steam table, it's generally quite good&&&&ambience+food
I this doesn't strike me as a place to eat sushi&&&&food
Evenings and weekends are priced higher&&&&cost+food
they generally have crab legs and beef ribs&&&&food
Staff is generally friendly and attentive&&&&service
Went by this place last week and it is now closed down&&&&service
The servers are polite and its cheap&&&&cost+service
They recently renovated and its much nicer inside&&&&food
If someone has a Chinese buffet that beats it out on price and quality in this area please do tell&&&&cost+food
Being greeted on the way in with a "You are on camera" sign sure is welcoming&&&&service
I was quickly greeted, though, and directed to my seat&&&&food
My drink order was taken before I even sat down, which was nice&&&&food+service
Too many buffets have you walk in, sit down, select a beverage, stand up, and proceed to self-service, and it was nice to save a couple of steps&&&&food+service
I got to the food&&&&food
the skin on the surface of the sweet-and-sour sauce was rubbery and at least a half-centimeter thick&&&&food
I did, however, find some acceptable-looking specimens and returned to my table&&&&ambience
The warmest of the foods could only generously be called lukewarm&&&&ambience+food+service
most of the chicken was marbled with glibbery wads of fat, and all the sauces tasted sugary and generic&&&&food
I could literally not tell the "orange chicken" from the "sesame chicken" from the "pepper chicken" by any sense other than sight&&&&food
The rice was room-temperature,&&&&food
I barely know this because as I was forking a mouthful of rice together on the plate, the alternately obsequious and intrusive waitstaff tried to take my plate out from under me (though, in retrospect, they may have been trying to save me)&&&&ambience+food+service
was in fact soggy and also room-temperature to lukewarm&&&&ambience+food
Walking toward the register, there was a prominent sign re-advising me that walk-outs are recorded and will be reported to the police and prosecuted&&&&food
There were three more similar signs at the register/gift shop (&&&&ambience
Again, very welcoming&&&&service
Spot check on this place = now closed&&&&ambience+service
When it was open it was ok at best&&&&service
Good food, though I didn't find any of the dishes outstanding, and there were not as many offerings as I would have expected for a super buffet&&&&food
The staff was very friendly, the restaurant spacious, and the meal was inexpensive and satisfying - a good meal at a good price&&&&cost+food+service
Typical bar food selection&&&&ambience+food
the food is not so bad&&&&food
The atmosphere is great though&&&&food
Awesome for avid sports fans&&&&ambience
They have a huge selection of beers, wines and hard liquor so this is a great place to hang out&&&&food
) service is a bit slow here and it was a bit hard to get our drinks refilled&&&&food+service
the atmosphere can't be beat&&&&food
This is a good place to hang out and eat, just not the biggest of menus&&&&food
We got burgers and first off, the bread&&&&food
They looked like the 8 pack burger buns you get for an outdoor cookout&&&&food
They looked and tasted cheap&&&&cost+food
I got the A1 Mushroom burger and it was pretty good, except I ordered medium well and it was pretty well done even tasted a bit of a char (not a good thing, IMO)&&&&food+service
My wife got a burger that was flavorless&&&&food
The service was great&&&&food+service
The beer was great&&&&food
Decor of the place was great&&&&ambience+food
It was just the food that left a little to be desired&&&&food
It was cool to have a TV at the table, probably a great place to watch the game with the guys&&&&ambience+food
Walked in, hostess rushed us in to a huge booth within the bar with open door&&&&ambience+service
Why not ask if we were there for dinner, drinks? Both? Ask a preference of seating&&&&food
The open air area was a complete hot box, very humid to the point that people were sticking to the booths&&&&ambience+food+service
Server arrived and could tell we were annoyed, we informed her that it was our first time there, we were just rushed in, and wanted to switch to the other side&&&&ambience
We did, she again just rushed us over to the booth as if there was something wrong with sitting at the bar itself&&&&ambience
sat in a different booth for a full 15 minutes without a single employee coming over to us&&&&food+service
While the décor was great, coming from the service industry while in high school and college they lost me for good&&&&food+service
I would never even go back to try the food&&&&food
seated for 15 minutes and no one came to even take a drink order&&&&food+service
I had heard some bad reviews about Brewstone, especially about the service there&&&&food+service
So I was not expecting a great time when I walked in on Wednesday night&&&&food
However they do have a fairly good list of craft beer available, as well as the regular cra*&&&&ambience
The service was very good&&&&food+service
Our waiter, Lindley (?) was very nice and attentive, extremely helpful as was the bartender in the back bar&&&&ambience+food+service
The food was good, I had a burger (cooked perfectly, very tasty) It was a little loud, there was a live musician playing by the patio area,&&&&ambience+food
in the back by the restrooms the place was much quieter&&&&ambience
Nice design and sporty atmosphere surround you in this large detailed restaurant&&&&food
Food is decent&&&&food
Ordered mac and cheese&&&&food+service
got more of a penne Alfredo instead&&&&food
not quite what I ordered&&&&service
and I'm clear the server was high&&&&ambience
There is a large bar and huge seating area that seemed like sports bar meets high class lounge&&&&ambience+food
There are traditional bar favorites,&&&&ambience
The two of us could have eaten it and not had an entree and still been full&&&&food
It was tasty,&&&&food
they should consider cutting the portion and the price&&&&cost+food
Or at least having a half order option&&&&service
I loved the taste and texture and was disappointed when it was gone&&&&food
The burger, sliders and pasta were all OK,&&&&food
We'll probably be back to try other dishes and possibly happy hour specials (half priced martinis),&&&&cost+food
we won't be rushing back&&&&ambience
" to the "Breakway Bar and Grill" and is under new management&&&&ambience
Two bars full bars, one indoor and one indoor/outdoor&&&&ambience
The indoor bar is in between the main entrance and the dining room&&&&ambience
The indoor/outdoor bar has booths with personal TV's, an "O" shaped bar with plenty of big screen TV's, and roll up doors which are open on nice nights leading to the outdoor patio&&&&ambience+food+service
The place is very nice and clean&&&&ambience+food
Very nice look and upkeepDrink&&&&food
Great beer selection&&&&food
PLUS, they have a two full bars for people who love liquor&&&&ambience
Food has changed since the name has changed and the business is under new management&&&&food
not quiet the same and they have rid the menu of many of the items that I liked&&&&ambience
They have a good variety consisting of steak, chicken, sea food, burgers, and homemade pizzas&&&&food
Overall the food is decent&&&&food
Great overall&&&&food
Dining room and inside bar are a good casual family area&&&&ambience
The Indoor/Outdoor bar is separate and has more of a casual bar feel to it&&&&ambience+cost
Great place for any occasion and for sports games&&&&food
they are certainly not great either&&&&food
Some of the waiters/waitresses are good and some not so much&&&&service
All of them are friendly however some seem very new while others are veterans in the food service&&&&food+service
The service is very inconsistent&&&&food+service
I miss the Indoor/Outdoor bar being open more often&&&&ambience+service
It really gave the place a different dimension and a more causal relaxing feel that nowhere else really offers during nice days&&&&ambience+food
I also miss the homemade dressings, specialty pizzas, BBQ sauce, and custom burgers&&&&food
The Brewstone was perfect for a casual dinner and drinks&&&&food
We ordered a couple of appetizers and a flight of three different beers&&&&ambience+service
They had a large selection of beer to choose from and the food menu was great&&&&food
The prices were good and the food we got was very good&&&&cost+food
Brewstone has lost their liquor license due to being habitually delinquent in playing alcoholic drink tax to the Allegheny County treasurer's office&&&&food
They have been permanently closed for months&&&&service
This time a burger&&&&food
This burger was ordered medium and came out burned and hard and bad as a cinder block&&&&food+service
Why would they send that out to someone to eat&&&&food
Disgrace in the back&&&&service
Who is in charge back there&&&&cost
Onion soup was so-so&&&&food
Called the manager and told him, they need to do something in the kitchen, because I would really hope they could be better&&&&service
Why, well the environment here is outstanding, a great venue, and the beer is good enough&&&&ambience+food
We asked to speak to a Manager, and the manager Carrie was extremely friendly, customer service oriented, and helped make our visit a much better experience&&&&food+service
Long story short, we waited 35 minutes for our appetizer which was just cheese sticks, and&&&&food
waited over an hour and 15 minutes for our dinner&&&&food
My wife ordered a burger which ended up coming out like a brick it was so overcooked&&&&food+service
I ordered the boneless wings with mild sauce and the wings were overcooked, and cold when I got them&&&&ambience+food+service
It looked like they were actually put in the microwave by the way the sauce was by the time I got them&&&&food
After waiting an hour and 15 minutes, we were not happy at all&&&&food
The manager (Carrie) came over and apologized to us for the quality of the food, and for the wait time, and assured us she would take care of it&&&&food+service
Within 10 minutes, we had a replacement of our wings and burger, and this time they were cooked perfectly&&&&food
Carrie also compensated us the check for the wait time and the food being messed up the first time around&&&&food
Turns out that there were 2 parties of over 30 people booked at the same exact time and the kitchen ran behind&&&&ambience
I had a great experience at Brewstone&&&&food
The server was great and very knowledgeable about the beers&&&&food
She recommended a terrific wheat beer that I very much enjoyed&&&&food
The portions were huge and you really get what you pay for&&&&cost
The food is also very good&&&&food
I just bought a gift certificate for Brewstone to have an excuse to go back&&&&ambience
Perhaps most the opening week jitters have been corrected&&&&service
As mentioned in another review, the place is spotless&&&&ambience
They invested some serious cash in converting the decor from what used to be a dimly lit John Harvards location&&&&ambience
Two bars seems odd however&&&&ambience
I went with the fish and chips as it's my baseline for what any bar/pub should get right without worry&&&&ambience+food
It was a bit light on fish and heavy on fries&&&&ambience+food
both were good, so I can't really complain for the price&&&&cost+food
Better half had the BBQ pork sliders (carolina style) and thoroughly enjoyed them&&&&ambience+food
Mixed drink for her and draft micro for me seemed reasonably priced&&&&cost+food
should go over extremely well with the sports crowd and should do wonders for BW3's prices and awful service across the street&&&&cost+food+service
Wait staff seemed very attentive&&&&service
this may also be because they just opened and over-compensate&&&&service
A roof over the patio seems necessary, we'll never sit outside on a sunny day without it and nobody was out there either on our visit&&&&ambience
We'll definitely be returning again to try the rest of the menu and catch the drink specials during a steeler game&&&&food
Glad to see something different than just another chain restaurant move in the empty spot in Penn Center&&&&ambience
Bartender overwhelmed with no one in the place&&&&ambience+food
I walked in at 9PM, Could get no service till 9&&&&food+service
no places open late&&&&service
and this is directly across from motel with everyone on business trips Duh&&&&ambience
I wonder if owners know bartender is inept and chasing people away at 9&&&&ambience+food
Since I work long hours, many times the criteria for a restaurant is how late it's open&&&&service
Sometimes, you get both (open and good)&&&&service
We were seated in one of the bars areas&&&&ambience+food
There were about 40 televisions just in this one space (this includes a personal TV at each table&&&&ambience
We ordered some late night snacks&&&&service
My fiance ordered their fish and chips special&&&&food+service
It was crisp and very fresh&&&&ambience+food
Wasn't as enthusiastic about the fries&&&&food
I ordered wings&&&&service
Maybe it was the time of day I was eating them,&&&&food
the Buffalo wings were crazy hot (spicy)&&&&ambience+food
They were all fresh and juicy&&&&ambience+food
The service was good&&&&food+service
Twinkly patio lights, huge, Sonoma-esque vibe inside&&&&ambience
We arrived and promptly checked out the huge specials board on entry&&&&ambience
We were seated, next to a screaming baby might I add, inside, even though we requested the patio&&&&food
half off lettuce wraps, which was advertised on the board as the next day's special&&&&ambience
We order beers anyway and hope for the best&&&&service
We order nachos that have no meat ingredients listed in the menu (unless you opt in), and they come smothered in beef chili&&&&food+service
NOT cool for vegetarians&&&&food
"While eating, we overhear two parties next to us request to speak to the manager&&&&food+service
Bill takes 45 minutes to arrive after requested&&&&cost+food
We pay full price and high-tail it out of there&&&&cost+food
The food was so so and there was nothing super spectacular about it&&&&food
I had a wedge salad which was OK except for the fact that the bleu cheese dressing was not bleu cheese dressing&&&&food
They were extremely over-cooked&&&&food
Everyone else had a burger and they all came out wrong or missing an ingredient&&&&food
The wait staff was great which counters for the ignorant hostesses&&&&ambience+food+service
The two girls were not welcoming&&&&service
They stood begins the counter which is in an odd place as you didn't know it was a host stand&&&&ambience
Lots of seating options indoors and out&&&&food
It's got the usual sports bar fare,&&&&ambience+cost
because the place looks so nice, I expected a more extensive menu that just a one page, black and white printed list of their offering&&&&food
Perhaps we got a game-time/lunch menu??The food&&&&food
Among the 6 of us, we ordered 2 kids of wings (Garlic Parm & the Whiskey Bourbon),&&&&food+service
Both flavors tasted pretty good&&&&food
though I would have liked a little more garlic or salt on the garlic parm flavor&&&&food
We also got the nachos - pretty standard, and a variety of burgers&&&&food
Everyone enjoyed the burgers&&&&food
Very flavorful and moist&&&&food
The drinks from the bar were pretty sweet&&&&ambience+food
The service&&&&food+service
Sure, it was game-time, opening weekend of the NFL season,&&&&service
Most of the patrons were seated in either of the two bar areas&&&&ambience+food
I only saw one table in the large dining room&&&&ambience
So, either the placed wasn't properly staffed by management for a game-time crowd, or the service was incredible slow&&&&food+service
Our server was very nice and courteous even when I'm sure she could tell we were getting annoyed with repeating requests for refills on drinks long empty, or asking about the status of our food,&&&&food+service
she kept a smile and responded politely&&&&service
The pricepoint&&&&cost+food
The prices were about what you'd expect for bar food&&&&ambience+cost+food
$10 for a burger, etc&&&&food
In all, while the food was pretty good and the set-up/layout of the place is nice, I think the only way I'd return is if I was truly there just to watch the game, and the drinks/snacks were an afterthought&&&&food
If I was going to hangout with friends and watch the game and wasn't going because I was hungry,&&&&ambience
Food Hounds&&&&food
every so often while on the road, we come across a place that is so incredible that it raises our standards in coolness and flavor&&&&food
An extremely large location with about four main dining areas and multiple bars, Brewstone not only serves up their own blends of house-brewed ale&&&&ambience
offers an array of mind-blowing food&&&&food
Right off the bat I was thrilled when they nailed my signature drink, The Brimstone Red - sweet and perfect&&&&food
Then they brought out this inconceivable platter of their Brewstone Signature Nachos that was utterly astonishing&&&&ambience
never before have I been this floored with the MASSIVE size and flavor behavior of&&&&food
Big enough for a hungry couple or a group, it was off the chain with tri-colored tortilla chips, fresh avocado, jack and cheddar cheese, house chili&&&&ambience+food
should I go on?  We opted for all three meats&&&&food
grilled chicken, steak and BBQ pulled pork to top our serving&&&&food
It came out piled-high with large chunks of chicken that had intense flavor and was moist, juicy and delish&&&&food
LOVED the sweet and tangy, smoky BBQ pork that was off the charts - total fan&&&&food
As for the steak&&&&food
sweet and unbelievable&&&&food
Best nachos EVER in Food Hound history to date&&&&food
Sashimi grade Ahi Tuna coated with black and white sesame seeds&&&&food
the presentation was enticing - thick and meaty slices, cool and refreshing, fresh and fantasmic&&&&ambience+food
I thoroughly enjoyed their wasabi mousse - sweet and spicy with flavor that just makes you want more - WIN&&&&ambience+food
The Chicken Lettuce Wraps were simple and divine&&&&food
lettuce, chicken, wontons and carrots with a BOSS ginger soy sauce that enhances the taste of the whole shebang&&&&food
Something new that we've never experienced before was the Tri-Colored Cheese Sticks - the BIG difference is the use of cheddar as opposed to the typical mozzarella&&&&food
they utilize crushed tri-color tortilla chips in the batter used to coat the cheese before frying&&&&ambience+food
So fantastic and unique - they are paired with a spicy marinara and crispy onion straws for good measure&&&&ambience+food
Of course we had to try the Mac & Cheese - a hefty helping of over four cheeses co-mingling with penne,&&&&food
topped with big chunks of luscious chicken to create a hot, steamy mini-meal (make sure every bite has some chicken)&&&&ambience+food
The Corn Chowder had a chunky consistency of potatoes and corn with just a hint of seasoning with a bit of a kick to pop your taste buds&&&&ambience+food
we enjoyed a Tex-Mex Sandwich which was an overwhelming roller coaster of zesty flavor - juicy chicken offers an even keel on this sandwich&&&&food
the pepper jack and jalapeno gives a spicy kick that is counteracted by the avocado adding a fresh cooling effect&&&&ambience+food
The Shrimp Alfredo's flavor is ka-pow&&&&food
big, juicy shrimp doused in an intense alfredo sauce - a hefty serving for a hungry critter&&&&food
Another big deal at Brewstone is their signature pizza - the Meatball Pizza was a solid and delicious pie&&&&food
the meatballs were large, chunky and offered a great rendition of an old classic&&&&food
I almost passed out after the first bite of the Pulled Pork BBQ Pizza as it was orgasmic&&&&food
Sweet, smoky and explosive - stacked with fresh corn, their unreal pulled BBQ pork and delectable caramelized onions&&&&ambience+food
full of cheese with a killer flavor&&&&food
absurdly GREAT&&&&food
Lastly, the Chicken Madeira was like eating a Thanksgiving dinner&&&&food
with chicken- creamy mashed potatoes and sautéed green beans that were juicy, fresh and crunchy&&&&ambience+food
The chicken itself was tender and tucked into the plate with a thick blanket of mozzarella cheese and&&&&ambience+food
Everything was incredible from the food to the service and the environment itself&&&&ambience+food+service
The beer choices seem really good&&&&food
The food is really not worth the price&&&&cost+food
We asked what was great and she said, "Well, pizza is really good,&&&&food
our pizza chef isn't in yet&&&&food
So, I ordered a burger, medium, that had goat cheese and bacon (server told me not to get the goat cheese because it can be "overpowering"--another bad sign since goat cheese is quite mild,&&&&food+service
Burger was overdone and not very juicy, and they left off the bacon and lettuce and tomatoes were smaller than the burger--not what you expect for a $11 burger&&&&ambience+food
Wife orders an ahi tuna salad vinaigrette on the side&&&&food+service
Tuna was definitely cooked in the morning and refrigerated&&&&cost+food
It was dried out and scaly and they put the dressing on the salad anyways and put a second side of dressing&&&&food
The dressing was unbelievably strong in vinegar flavor&&&&food
$16 worth of salad that was really something you expect to get at a luxury vending machine&&&&cost+food
she could have mentioned that they had a very limited draft list and that what I was ordering was a bottle&&&&service
Food wasn't good&&&&food
Service was, meh&&&&food+service
We always go twice in case it was just a fluke,&&&&food
judging by other reviews, this may be a drinks-only kind of place&&&&food
Fresh tasty Cobb salad&&&&ambience+food
Tasty burger with bacon&&&&food
Nice meal, great service, reasonable prices&&&&cost+food+service
as with everyone else, the decor is very nice and very inviting&&&&ambience+food
Waitress was rude, messed up our order, took 25 min (empty restaurant)&&&&service
The burgers we ordered were burnt, we ordered medium, and the soup tasted frozen out of a bag&&&&food+service
After we received our check, the waitress disappeared, not asking us for additional drinks etc&&&&food
We chose to walk up to the bar and order additional beers,   the bartender was mute at best&&&&ambience+food+service
the whole staff was uneducated&&&&service
Its a shame, cause this place could have soo much potential and we want it to succeed&&&&ambience+food
thousands of dollars on decor and frozen food does not make a restaurant&&&&ambience+food
Our friends suggested "Breakaway Bar & Grill" or Brewstone, or whatever name they are going by&&&&ambience
The short women with longer black hair took the reservation and had a HORRIBLE attitude&&&&ambience
She called our name and we gathered our belongs in hopes that we were going to be seated, she said, "No&&&&food
you aren't being seated&&&&food
Ok? We finally got seated after a few minutes of confusion because obviously she had no clue what she was doing&&&&food
We sat at a large high top table and waited 10 minutes before our server finally arrived to take our drink orders&&&&ambience+food+service
Then another 5-7 before finally taking our food order&&&&food+service
The food menu was lackluster, generic & over priced&&&&cost+food
I ordered a burger to be cooked "medium" with a side of sweet potato fries and my husband ordered a pizza&&&&ambience+food+service
When our food arrived my burger was cooked well-done, flavorless & the sweet potato fries were room temperature at best&&&&ambience+food
My husband stated that his pizza was sub-par at best and was clearly frozen pizza crust instead of freshly made&&&&ambience+food
Throughout the course of visit random people (I'm assuming who were management&&&&ambience
was hard to tell from their very causal jeans and tshirt) came by to take empty plates instead of asking about our food&&&&ambience+food
Our waitress was scarce so we were often left with empty glasses&&&&ambience
Needless to say, we won't be returning due to poor attitudes & over-priced below average food&&&&cost+food
Their service is absolutely terrible&&&&food+service
their food is delicious, great beer selection&&&&food
when it takes 45 minutes to get appetizers or 15 minutes for a draft beer its unacceptable&&&&ambience+food
She was knowledgable about the food and alcohol&&&&food
The food was fresh and tasty (&&&&ambience+food
I would not say this is a food destination for me), and the regional manager stopped at our table to offer an apology for the last time we were in&&&&ambience+food+service
With that being said, I know we will be back to this place because it is a great place to hang out with friends and family, and I appreciated their attempt to win back a customer who was very disappointed&&&&food
The place was not very crowded&&&&ambience
the food and service was terrible&&&&food+service
I had a chicken dish that was so salty i simply could not eat it&&&&food
Our server never returned to fill our drinks or ask us how the meal was&&&&food
The food was alright and they have a decent selection of beer&&&&food
The only drawback with the outside is the only view you have is a sweeping expanse of parking lot&&&&food
I ordered coleslaw with my dinner and it looks to be homemade&&&&food+service
There were big pieces of cabage all through instead of shredded cabage like you normally see&&&&ambience+food
Really bad service&&&&food+service
Tried it last week food was ok and service was bad&&&&food+service
Tried again service was really slow, really bad&&&&food+service
Bartender has no clue what to do when you place an empty drink closer and closer  to the the edge of the bar&&&&ambience+food
Hopefully some one from there will read this and let him in on a clue you fill the drink after you walk past it at least three times&&&&food
The best part is lets you a glass to get ice out of the ice bin&&&&ambience+food
The bartender pretty much talked to one group of guys on the other side of the bar and ignored the rest of the bar&&&&ambience+food+service
Have no clue who the bartender was&&&&ambience+food
I went here for a happy hour/light dinner and sat in the bar&&&&ambience
The booth was extremely comfortable and i love the TVs at the table&&&&ambience
Others have had issues with both the food and/or the service&&&&food+service
Our server was both friendly and efficient - she did explain that the restaurant is undergoing a transition to a new brand, "Breakaway Grill" and therefore the menu was a little different and the beer list wasn't up-to-date&&&&service
Food came out quickly and the potachos were decent&&&&ambience+food
could have used a bit more cheese&&&&food
I also tried the BBQ Chicken Flatbread - and it was good&&&&ambience+food
Granted it wasn't extremely busy so I can't speak to how the service would have been if they had been busier&&&&food+service
This isn't my first choice of place to go on a Friday or a Saturday night,&&&&food
Their food is good&&&&food
I like the margarita pizza the best&&&&food
The atmosphere is warm and modern&&&&ambience
The service is terrible&&&&food+service
Usually bike nights are informal sit where you want&&&&service
The hostess had to go and see if there were tables available&&&&ambience
This took her a few minutes and she informed us she would have to move a table&&&&ambience+food
Then the waitress came over and told us we took some one else's table&&&&ambience
No one sat at the table the whole time we were there&&&&ambience
Then the waitress took our order, not when she originally talked to us&&&&service
a few minutes later&&&&food
She barely knew the specials&&&&ambience
We ordered our drinks&&&&food+service
The waitress brought them in a reasonable time only to spill one in front of me and the other on my leg&&&&ambience
I asked about the food specials posted, and she said they did not have any&&&&food
I asked a manager as well&&&&service
The cards on the table said food specials&&&&ambience+food
Then the waitress brought the check&&&&ambience
Our beers were full price&&&&cost+food
They were $4 per beer and had two different prices after this beer tax&&&&cost+food
On the way out the manager did not even ask about the evening&&&&service
I gave it 2 stars versus 1 because I did not try the food&&&&food
If the food is bad&&&&food
The service is poor&&&&food+service
Good decor&&&&ambience
Great beer selection&&&&food
$5 craft beer pints, typical on what you would pay for those&&&&cost
Waiter was knowledgable about the beer&&&&service
Food was ok&&&&food
We had a salad and pulled pork and it wasn't anything amazing for the price&&&&cost+food
LOST THEIR LIQUOR LICENSE&&&&food
Hostess explained that they had lost their liquor license s couple of weeks ago&&&&food
We stayed anyway and found the food to be quite good&&&&food
service was slow&&&&food+service
We also noticed that they didn't inform some guests of the liquor issue until they were seated, which I found to be somewhat disingenuous&&&&food
Saw this place when driving in Monroeville and stopped in, turned out it was opening week so I hope it gets better&&&&service
they had one of the worst beer selections I've ever seen at a bar, although their online menu listed dozens of beers as "coming soon"   Our waitress was unfamiliar with the beer selection they did have as well&&&&ambience
The food was not very good either, I had chipotle chicken sliders and they were bland with no hint of chipotle and the chicken was tough to the point I felt like I needed a kinfe to cut it&&&&ambience+food
The best thing I have to say about this place is that it was very clean,&&&&ambience
it's only been open for a week&&&&service
We were very excited to have a new restaurant open in the former John Harvard's space, as it's very close to our house and we go out to eat often&&&&food+service
It's without a doubt a warm, welcoming environment (although I could do without so many TVs everywhere)&&&&ambience+service
Service was slow to the point that the manager came out to apologize&&&&food+service
Some of the food was good (I liked the fish tacos) and other dishes were average&&&&food
Service was again very slow&&&&food+service
I don't expect waiting 15 minutes for drinks to arrive&&&&food
I didn't want to wait for our waiter to return, so I walked the beer over to the bar&&&&ambience+service
The bartender replaced it with a "sorry" without any sincerity&&&&ambience+food
We tried the quesadilla and pizza and both were average at best&&&&food
The fries are not so great either&&&&food
I'd give Brewstone 5 stars for ambience/decor, and perhaps 1 1/2 stars for food and service&&&&ambience+food+service
Excellent staff and really good burgers&&&&food+service
Fun sports bar atmosphere with a touch of class&&&&ambience
To be fair, it has been several months since I visited Brewstone, so things may have changed since&&&&ambience
Since the place is a Sports bar, I am going to go with that "format"&&&&ambience
Instead of telling you what beer is what, the menu and the wait staff give you a vague, general idea of what beer you are going to get, such as a "citrusy, hoppy beer," (which equates to an IPA) or a "dark, sweet beer," (a stout)&&&&ambience+food+service
They should just tell you it's a "Stone IPA," or "Founder's Breakfast Stout," instead of letting you "guess&&&&food
The service was less than stellar&&&&food+service
after we ordered our drinks,  the waitress said she couldn't find the bartender, so there was a delay&&&&ambience+food+service
The food, again wasn't great&&&&food
I got a burger and it was so-so&&&&food
My wife was mad that she didn't even get a piece of bread with her salad&&&&food
I spoke to someone else who ate there and they really liked the food, so maybe it was what we ordered&&&&food+service
