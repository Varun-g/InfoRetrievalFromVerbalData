Love this place. Dog friendly ... Rotating beers on draft. The staff is super knowledgable about the menu. Menu is a little weird but every thing I've had so far was good. I recommend this place! Chill environment - definitely would visit again.

Best ribs you won't regret. Me and my family were surprised we had to serve ourselves though and the table could have been a lot cleaner. But a good meal is a good meal

We had the opportunity to have dinner with our daughter and her friend last night. After arriving we waited about 15 minutes to be seated. They were not terribley busy. We were seated and again waited about 15 minutes to be acknowledged.  Our server was polite and seemed somewhat overwhelmed.  We ordered drinks and appetizers. My husband ordered a soft drink.Our main courses consisted of two rib specials and two steaks.
SPEAKER: M2
The food was ok, my disappointment is at the fact that during the whole time, did anyone remove our dirty dishes or even check to see if anything else was needed. At the end of the meal the server did come back to ask if we needed more drinks.  Still he did not remove any of the dishes or empty glasses. The busser passed our table several times, and still did not remove anything. I felt as if I had a whole setof dinner wear just piled in front of us. We won't return to this TGIF because of the cutomer service.

Food was great. Our waitress, Jen, was very friendly and accommodating. Restaurant is just a bit too noisy.  Great Hollywood memorabilias on the walls. Food portions were average.  The tables were just too close to each other. I could hear the conversations of the table beside ours.  This restaurant is a great casual meeting place to grab something to eat.
